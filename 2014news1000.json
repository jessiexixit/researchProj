Wal-Mart will reimburse customers who bought the tainted “Five Spice” donkey meat and is helping local food and industry agencies in eastern Shandong province investigate its Chinese supplier, it said late on Wednesday in official posts on China’s Twitter-like Weibo. The Shandong Food and Drug Administration earlier said the product contained fox meat.  The scandal could dent Wal-Mart’s reputation for quality in China’s $1 trillion food and grocery market where it plans to open 110 new stores in the next few years. China is the largest grocery market in the world and is set to grow to $1.5 trillion by 2016, according to the Institute of Grocery Distribution.  “This is another hit on Wal-Mart’s brand, meaning wealthy shoppers will start to lose the trust they had before,” said Shaun Rein, Shanghai-based managing director of China Market Research (CMR) Group. CMR estimates Wal-Mart’s market share fell from 7.5 percent to 5.2 percent over the last three years.  Donkey meat is a popular snack in some areas of China, although it only accounts for a tiny fraction of overall meat consumption. In 2011 China slaughtered 2.4 million donkeys, according to country’s livestock industry yearbook.  TRACK RECORD  Wal-Mart, French grocer Carrefour SA, McDonald’s Corp and KFC-parent Yum Brands Inc among others, have come under fire before in China over food safety issues, a sensitive topic in a country riddled with scares from a fatal tainted milk scandal to recycled “gutter oil” used for cooking.  Wal-Mart said it had set up an investigation team to look into the incident, would strengthen food safety rules and take legal action against the product supplier. It added the person in charge at the supplier factory had already been detained.  “We are deeply sorry for this whole affair,” said Wal-Mart’s China president and CEO, Greg Foran. “It is a deep lesson (for us) that we need to continue to increase investment in supplier management.”  The U.S. retailer has had a troubled past in China. In 2011, China fined Wal-Mart, along with Carrefour, a combined 9.5 million yuan ($1.57 million) for manipulating product prices. Wal-Mart was also fined that year in China for selling duck meat past its expiry date.  Food safety scandals can have a significant impact in China. Yum has struggled to recover sales in China more than a year after a chicken supplier to KFC in the country was found to have used excess levels of antibiotics. Analysts, though, said the impact of the current scare would be far more subdued.  Wal-Mart, which operates more than 400 facilities in China, competes with market leaders Sun Art Retail Group Ltd and China Resources Enterprise Ltd, which in August teamed up with British retailer Tesco Plc.  Consumers on popular microblogging site Sina Weibo were at a loss whether to criticise Wal-Mart or support it. Online sentiment can spread quickly in China where there is a high proportion of social media users.  “Isn’t fox meat more expensive than donkey meat anyway?” asked one bemused user." }

A worker operates a machine to cut a pipeline at a factory in Qingdao, Shandong province November 29, 2013. REUTERS/China Daily  The final HSBC/Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) slipped to a three-month low of 50.5 in December from 50.8 in November. Thursday’s reading was unchanged from a preliminary figure issued last month.  The private survey was consistent with the government’s PMI, which on Wednesday dipped to a four-month low 51.0. Both measures remained above the 50 point level that separates expansion from contraction.  “The economy is still growing, no doubt, but the growth momentum has weakened,” said Yao Wei, economist at Societe Generale in Hong Kong.  “The major factors that had helped drive the strong recovery in Q3 and the first half of Q4, such as restocking and property construction, has somewhat softened towards the end of the year,” she added.  Beijing has said it will accept slower growth as it tries to reshape the economy towards more sustainable growth, based on consumer demand, after three decades of breakneck expansion led by exports and credit.  Top leaders have pledged reasonable growth in 2014, and sources at top government think tanks told Reuters they expect a growth target of 7.5 percent, the same as for 2013.  The HSBC/Markit PMI is more weighted towards smaller and private companies than the official one, which contains more large and state-owned firms.  EXPORT ORDERS DRAG  In the HSBC/Markit PMI, a sub-index measuring new export orders touched a four-month low of 49.1, the first time since August that it dropped below 50 points. Similarly, the official PMI showed new export orders contracting for the first time since July, suggesting unsteady external demand.  The private PMI’s sub-index of overall output eased in December from November’s eight-month high, showing that domestic demand is not strong enough to offset shrinking external orders.  A sub-index measuring quantity of purchases also dipped to a three-month low, indicating less appetite to build up stocks.  Tight credit conditions are seen as another reason behind the slower economic growth. Last month money market rates rose to their highest since a cash crunch in June, and rates are expected to remain elevated as the lunar new year approaches.  “We think this is a major factor entering 2014 which is going to affect the growth negatively, and the impact will be profound in the short term,” Yao Wei at Societe Generale said.  Some officials and bankers have said borrowing costs are set to rise in the longer term as Beijing cracks down on unofficial lending and moves towards a market-based interest-rate regime." }

The ruling Communist Party’s anti-corruption watchdog said on Sunday that the former aide, Li Chongxi, was being investigated for corruption.  On Thursday, the official Xinhua news agency said Li had been removed from his post as head of an advisory body to the legislature in the southwestern province of Sichuan “for suspected severe violations of discipline”, a euphemism for corruption.  “Authorities are investigating his case according to procedure,” Xinhua said, citing a statement from the Communist Party’s powerful Organisation Department.  It provided no further details and it was not possible to reach Li for comment.  President Xi Jinping has launched a sweeping crackdown on corruption since taking power, warning that the problem is a threat to the Communist Party’s very survival and vowing to go after powerful “tigers” as well as lowly “flies”.  Zhou, who sources have told Reuters has been put under virtual house arrest, was party boss of Sichuan from 1999-2002, and it became one of his powerbases.  During Zhou’s tenure in Sichuan, Li was promoted to a deputy provincial party boss and head of the province’s anti-graft body, according to his official biography.  Two other senior Sichuan officials are being investigated, including Li Chuncheng, another former deputy Sichuan party chief.  Several of Zhou’s political allies have been taken into custody and questioned for corruption, including former Vice Minister of Public Security Li Dongsheng and Jiang Jiemin, the top regulator of state-owned enterprises for just five months until September.  In a separate case, Xinhua said a senior official in the southern province of Hunan had been sacked and expelled from the party for his role in an election bribery scandal.  More than 500 lawmakers in Hunan’s Hengyang city resigned last month after being implicated in the scandal.  Xinhua said Tong Mingqian was fired as deputy head of Hunan’s advisory body to parliament “for dereliction of duty which caused major electoral fraud”, and will be prosecuted." }

The final HSBC/Markit manufacturing Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) slipped to a three-month low at 50.5 in December from November’s 50.8, as export orders and output weakened.  By midday, the Hang Seng Index was down 0.3 percent at 23,249.28 points, while the China Enterprises Index of the top Chinese listings in Hong Kong fell 1.3 percent to its one-week low.

Factory growth in China - the second largest oil consumer - slowed in late 2013, although the purchasing managers’ indexes published by the government and HSBC remained above 50 for December, indicating business activity is still expanding.  China’s factory activity expanded at the slowest pace in three months in December, according to the HSBC survey, consistent with views the economy’s growth rate has moderated.  “The Chinese PMI data were not exactly bullish,” IHS oil consultant Victor Shum said. “The only thing supporting oil prices is probably the U.S. inventories.”  February Brent crude edged up 20 cents from Tuesday to $111 a barrel by 0348 GMT. U.S. crude for February delivery was at $98.64, up 22 cents.  Markets were shut on Wednesday for the New Year.  Data from the American Petroleum Institute showed on Tuesday a drop of 5.7 million barrels in U.S. crude stockpiles, nearly double the 3-million-barrel draw expected by analysts surveyed by Reuters.  The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) will release its data on Jan. 3 due to the holiday.  Lower U.S. inventories helped buoy the West Texas Intermediate (WTI) oil price in 2013. The average for the past year was $98.05 a barrel, up 4.2 percent from $94.14 in 2012.  The average Brent price for 2013 was $108.70 in 2013, down 2.7 percent from $111.68 in 2012 in a well-supplied market despite disruptions in the Middle East, Africa and North Sea.  Production in Libya, Iran, Iraq and the United States will be closely watched this year, IHS’ Shum said, in addition to any signs of further stimulus tapering by the U.S. Federal Reserve.  In Libya, oil output is still less than 250,000 barrels per day (bpd), down from 1.4 million bpd in July, as ports in the eastern part of the country remain shut.  South Sudanese President Salva Kiir declared a state of emergency in two states on Wednesday as his negotiators prepared for peace talks with rebels to end more than two weeks of violence that has pushed the country towards civil war.  Iran and six world powers will implement an agreement in late January obliging Tehran to suspend its most sensitive nuclear work, an Iranian official was quoted as saying on Tuesday, a move that could see Iranian oil exports rising soon.

Analysts said the move was to encourage lending and boost private sector credit growth to help expand the economy.  The central bank renamed its repurchase rate and reverse repurchase rate as the standing deposit facility rate and the standing lending facility rate. It left the standing deposit facility rate unchanged at 6.50 percent.  The Monetary Board feels the “volatility in the interbank call money market has reduced substantially”, allowing a narrowing in the difference between the reverse repo and the repo rate, the central bank said in a statement.  “It is expected that this compression will facilitate the reduction of the interest spread of banks over time, without affecting the deposit rates offered by banks to their customers.”  The standard spread between deposit and loan rates is 4 percent, but it can reach 10 pct depending on the customer’s creditworthiness.  The central bank also said it has decided to stop providing collateral to the participants in the open market operation under standing deposit facility (repurchase) with effect from Feb. 1. 2014.  The bank also removed a minimum cash margin requirement of 100 percent against letters of credit opened with commercial banks for the import of certain categories of motor vehicles, considering the improvement in the external sector.  It said the trade deficit in the first 11 month has narrowed 10.7 percent to $7.8 billion.  SLUGGISH CREDIT GROWTH  During the 11 months between December 2012 and October 2013, Sri Lanka cut its key policy rates by 125 basis points to boost economic growth, which is estimated to have been 7.2 percent last year, compared with 6.4 percent in 2012.  Yields in benchmark 91-day T-bills have fallen 302 basis points since the central bank started easing monetary policy in December 2012, while yields of 182-day and 364-day T-bills have dropped 425 basis points and 450 basis points respectively.  However, credit growth in the private sector has been sluggish, the latest central bank data showed.  Credit to the private sector slowed to 7.4 percent year-on-year in October, compared to 7.6 percent a month ago and 25.1 percent a year ago.  “The central bank is trying to boost confidence in the economy by encouraging lending through lower interest rates,” an economist said on condition of anonymity.  “But business firms and people are concerned about high taxes. So it might take some time for them to adjust.”  Investors have been wary of Sri Lanka’s policy environment because of inconsistency in the past. The government, for example, raised taxes on the banking, retail and telecommunication sectors in its 2014 budget presented in November.  A Reuters poll of 10 analysts had expected the central bank to cut the both key monetary policy rates by 50 basis points. (Reporting by Shihar Aneez and Ranga Sirilal; Editing by Eric Meijer)" }

The dollar held steady at 105.24 yen, clinging near a high of 105.41 yen set on Monday according to Thomson Reuters data, the dollar’s strongest level versus the yen since October 2008.  The dollar stayed in a narrow intraday range versus the yen on Thursday, with Japanese financial markets still closed on Thursday and Friday for the New Year’s break.  The greenback jumped more than 21 percent against the yen in 2013, its biggest yearly percentage gain versus the Japanese currency since 1979, according to Thomson Reuters data.  Differing outlooks for monetary policy in the United States and Japan have been key to the dollar’s surge against the yen, and the start of the Fed’s tapering of its stimulus could lead to further gains for the dollar in 2014.  By contrast, markets expect the Bank of Japan to maintain or even increase its massive stimulus to beat deflation.  Market participants are now focusing on U.S. economic data for clues on how quickly the Fed will scale back its monetary stimulus in coming months. The Fed said in December that it would trim its monthly asset purchases by $10 billion to a total of $75 billion per month from January.  “A focal point is whether there is going to be a reduction of $10 billion at every meeting, or whether they will wait and see for a while after announcing in December that there would be a $10 billion reduction from this month,” said Teppei Ino, a Singapore-based analyst for the Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ.  “I think there is a significant difference between those two,” he added.  Economic data on Tuesday showed that U.S. consumers’ mood improved as 2013 drew to a close, with many optimistic about their future job prospects, while home prices rose again in October, though the pace of gains slowed.  Later on Thursday, the dollar could take its cues from data on U.S. weekly jobless claims and the Institute for Supply Management’s index of national factory activity.  The euro rose 0.1 percent to about $1.3767, having set a two-year high of $1.3894 last Friday.

Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke triggered a bond market selloff and outflows from bond funds when he told Congress in May that the central bank could begin reducing its monthly bond-buying stimulus in 2013 if the U.S. economy looked strong enough.  The outflows from the fund, which is the flagship of the Los Angeles-based DoubleLine Capital LP, brought total outflows from the fund last year to about $6 billion, according to Morningstar.  The December outflows were the biggest in three months and more than doubled withdrawals of $811 million in November.  The fund had its first-ever monthly outflows in June, when investors withdrew $1.2 billion.  Gundlach, DoubleLine’s chief executive and chief investment officer, manages the roughly $31 billion fund. The fund rose a slight 0.02 percent last year, beating 87 percent of its peers according to Morningstar data.

The Korea Composite Stock Price Index (KOSPI) was down 1.2 percent at 1,986.83 points as of 0244 GMT, its sharpest daily percentage drop since mid-November.  “Mixed concerns about currency rates and corporate earnings are dragging the two largest components, translating into the market’s decline,” said Lee Eun-taek, an analyst at Dongbu Securities.  Samsung Electronics Co Ltd and Hyundai Motor Co together account for 21.1 percent of the KOSPI’s total capitalisation.  Despite South Korea’s 7.1 percent annual export growth in December and the manufacturing sector’s strongest expansion pace in 7-months in December, the depreciating yen against the won posed severe concerns for local exporters.  A weaker yen puts South Korean exporters under disadvantage against their Japanese rivals in price competitiveness, alarming local officials as well as Chinese officials.  Automakers Hyundai Motor and affiliate Kia Motors Corp announced their annual sales target of 4 percent in 2014 on Thursday, which was the weakest target since 2003, citing intensifying global competition and waning price advantage.  Hyundai Motor fell 4 percent and Kia Motors Corp plunged 4.5 percent by mid-session.  Samsung Electronics dropped 3.9 percent on lacklustre forecasts of October-December earnings due to currency moves and shrinking margins in its display business.  The banking sector bucked trend on the back of BS Financial Group Inc, which jumped 2.5 percent after being selected as preferred bidder to buy a regional bank unit of Woori Finance Holdings Co on Tuesday.  Institutional and foreign investors sold a combined net 180 billion Korean won ($170.6 million) worth of KOSPI shares by mid-session, weighing on the index.  Decliners outnumbered advancers 405 to 347.  The KOSPI 200 benchmark of core stocks was down 1.4 percent, while the junior KOSDAQ edged up 0.1 percent.

Figures from property consultant RPData-Rismark showed overall dwelling prices rose 9.8 percent in 2013, more than reversing two years of decline.  The year also ended on a bang with prices up 1.4 percent for December alone, accelerating from a 0.1 percent pace the previous month. For the fourth quarter, prices rose 2.8 percent.  While higher prices have stirred talk of a bubble, they are considered by policymakers as necessary to encourage a much-needed revival in home building.  The Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA), which cut interest rates to an historic low of 2.5 percent last August, has been counting on home construction to provide vital support to the economy as a long boom in mining investment cools.  Higher prices have also boosted household wealth, confidence and spending, exactly what easy monetary policy is meant to do.  Neither is the price appreciation exceptional by Australian standards. RPData’s Cameron Kusher noted that since 1996 there were seven years where prices grew faster than in 2013.  “The rate of growth was not that startling given the low interest rate environment and the previous successive years in which home values fell,” he said.  The gains have also been largely concentrated in a few hot spots, with four of Australia’s eight major cities seeing price growth of just 3.5 percent or less.  In contrast values in Sydney jumped 14.5 percent last year, while Perth enjoyed gains of 9.9 percent.  That growth owed much to investors attracted by relatively high rental yields, further boosted by a tax regime that allows investors to offset losses from investment property against income from other sources, and a favourable capital gains tax setup.  PAYING DOWN THE MORTGAGE  The value of mortgages for investment has been rising quickly for some time and reached a record high in October, up almost 29 percent on the same month a year earlier.  Such was the escalation in borrowing that it drew the displeasure of the central bank, which warned Australians against buying property in the hope of making a quick buck.  “The good news is that investors aren’t just buying established dwellings and driving up home prices, but money is being ploughed into new house and apartment developments and adding to housing supply,” said Craig James, chief economist at CommSec.  “It is clear that home construction will play a key role in driving the broader economy in 2014.”  Also reassuring policy makers is that total growth in credit has remained very subdued despite the rush into property investment. Credit outstanding rose by only 3.8 percent in the year to November, far below the long-run average of 12 percent.  While new lending for housing has risen strongly it has been offset by homeowners paying off their mortgages more quickly, a unique feature of the Australian market.  As interest rates have fallen in the past two years many mortgage holders chose to maintain their payments. The RBA estimates that no less than two thirds of the savings from lower rates has gone to repay debt.  “Old credit is being siphoned out much more rapidly than is usual, due to a swift pace of amortization in existing owner occupier mortgages,” said Ben Jarman, an economist at JPMorgan.  “Reduced interest burdens have freed up cash that existing mortgage holders have, to an unprecedented extent, elected to save rather then spend.” (Reporting by Wayne Cole; Editing by John Mair and Eric Meijer)" }

With the temperature teetering at 13 degrees and continuous snowfall hampering conditions on the ice, the Original Six rivals had difficulty moving the puck and maintaining any offensive consistency. Mother Nature briefly let up and the teams traded goals in both the second and third periods before Bozak ended the wild affair by snapping a low shot past United States Olympic goaltender Jimmy Howard and inside the left post.  James van Riemsdyk, who joined teammate Phil Kessel on the U.S. roster, scored while playing in his third Winter Classic and Jonathan Bernier made 41 saves for the Maple Leafs, who have won three in a row and improved 4-0-2 in their last six games. Captain Dion Phaneuf notched a pair of assists, one day after signing a seven-year, $49 million contract extension.  Daniel Alfredsson scored in his return from back spasms and former Michigan State star Justin Abdelkader backhanded home a centering feed to forge a tie with 5:32 remaining in the third period. Defenseman Brendan Smith set up both tallies and Howard turned aside 24 shots for the Red Wings, who have dropped nine of its their last 12 (3-6-3).  Detroit drew first blood by converting a 2-on-1 rush with 6:46 remaining in the second period as captain Henrik Zetterberg breezed in and wristed a centering feed that caromed off the right heel of Alfredsson and into the net. Van Riemsdyk answered from the right doorstep by batting the puck out of the air with 37 seconds left in the session before Bozak deflected Phaneuf’s soft wrist shot from the left point to give Toronto as 2-1 lead at 4:41 of the third.

The group also posted the contact information of Steve Ballmer, Microsoft Corp’s retiring chief executive, on its Twitter account along with the message, “You can thank Microsoft for monitoring your accounts/emails using this details. #SEA”  That message was an apparent reference to revelations last year by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden that Skype, which is owned by Microsoft, was part of the NSA’s program to monitor communications through some of the biggest U.S. Internet companies.  A message posted on Skype’s official Twitter feed on Wednesday, apparently by the hacking group, read: “Don’t use Microsoft emails (hotmail, outlook), They are monitoring your accounts and selling the data to the governments. More details soon. #SEA”  Similar messages were posted on Skype’s official Facebook pages and on a blog on its website before being taken down in late afternoon. The SEA later tweeted out copies of the message “for those who missed it.”  Representatives for Microsoft could not be reached for comment.  The NSA’s practices essentially made Microsoft and other technology companies partners in government surveillance efforts against private citizens in the United States and elsewhere.  Last month Microsoft joined seven other top technology companies in pressing President Barack Obama to rein in the U.S. government’s electronic spying in a meeting at the White House.  Media companies, including the New York Times and the BBC, have repeatedly been targeted by the Syrian Electronic Army and other hacker activist groups that deface websites and take over Twitter accounts.  Obama and his national security team are trying to decide what recommendations to adopt from an outside panel’s review of the NSA’s activities.  A U.S. District judge in December ruled that the U.S. government’s gathering of Americans’ phone records is likely unlawful and raised what he called “serious doubts” about the value of the so-called metadata counter-terrorism program.  A second federal judge ruled later in the month that the program was constitutional, raising the likelihood that the issue will be settled by the U.S. Supreme Court.  This week, a monitoring group said the death toll in Syria’s civil war, which began in March 2011 as peaceful protests against four decades of rule by Assad’s family, had risen to at least 130,000." }

The Spartans sealed the game with a fourth-down stop with 1:43 left to earn the first 13-win season in school history.

A Zapatista shows the way to followers of the Zapatista movement who have come along with thousands of others to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the armed indigenous insurgency in Oventic December 31, 2013. REUTERS/Claudia Daut  Now thousands of tourists and sympathizers come here every year to drink mojitos at a bar called Revolucion, visit nearby Zapatista communities with masked guides, and pick up souvenirs emblazoned with the image of Subcomandante Marcos, who thrilled leftists across the globe and won comparisons with Che Guevara.  Twenty years after Marcos led armed indigenous insurgents in Chiapas state in a “declaration of war” against the government the day Mexico opened its borders to free trade, the Zapatistas have faded from national view and their legacy is in question.  Named for Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata, the Zapatista National Liberation Army sparked a 12-day battle with the Army that claimed at least 140 lives, becoming an early symbol for supporters of the anti-globalization movement.  Today Chiapas remains Mexico’s poorest state, and Marcos, the Zapatistas’ masked poet leader, has all but disappeared.  Skilled in courting publicity, the pipe-smoking Marcos has not made any major public appearance since 2006, when he rode across Mexico on horseback to condemn its political class. He banned all media from the 20th anniversary celebrations.  “It’s December 2013. It’s just as cold as it was 20 years ago, and today, like back then, the same flag protects us: that of rebellion,” Marcos wrote in a 3,000-word communique published this week that railed against President Enrique Pena Nieto, his predecessor Felipe Calderon, and the “paid press.”  The Zapatistas brought to prominence the plight of the region’s impoverished Maya Indians, who were once so ostracized that they could not even walk on San Cristobal’s sidewalks.  But while money has flowed in from the government and private donors, many of the Zapatistas’ demands, especially for reform to grant the movement autonomy, have not been met.  In 2001, Congress passed legislation to give the indigenous more rights. But it was not enough for the Zapatistas, who set up their own autonomous justice, health and education systems in five municipalities in Chiapas known as caracoles, or shells.  In a visit granted to Reuters reporters in the Zapatista community of Oventic, the atmosphere was cheerful.  The gates were decorated with flowered wreaths, music played as footage of the Mexican army’s strike showed on televisions, and stalls sold revolutionary T-shirts and Zapatista figurines.  Murals honored the movement’s namesake and spelled out slogans like “Slow, but we’re advancing.” But every request to interview or photograph Zapatistas was denied by a community spokesman, who later forced the reporters to leave.  By contrast, hundreds of camera-toting fans were allowed in: coach buses crammed the narrow, mountainous road to Oventic, bringing visitors from as far away as France and Italy eager to participate in the Zapatista experience and buy trinkets.  ECONOMIC LIBERALISM  Neil Harvey, a New Mexico State University professor and author of “The Chiapas Rebellion,” estimates about 150,000 people live in the Zapatista communities, where indigenous leaders have raised living standards, including outlawing alcohol, improving women’s rights and creating Maya language schools.  “There is this existence of two authorities in Chiapas,” Harvey said. “Legally, it’s still not recognized by the Mexican government, but politically it’s tolerated.”  Still, more than three-quarters of Chiapas, which has one of Mexico’s largest indigenous populations, lives in poverty.  That compares with about half the Mexican population, which is little changed from when then-President Carlos Salinas signed up to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that came into force the day of the rebellion on January 1, 1994.  NAFTA was a major challenge to the Maya because it gave private investors the chance to buy land formerly in communal hands, and the Zapatistas declared it a “death sentence.”  But the economy has continued to open up ever since.  Last month Pena Nieto got a bill passed end Mexico’s 75-year-old oil and gas monopoly, in a move some analysts hailed as the biggest reform of the Mexican economy since NAFTA.  Marcos rejects claims the Zapatistas have failed, saying in his communique that interest in the group proves its relevance.  There is no doubting the fervor of supporters.  “The Zapatistas changed my life and opened my eyes politically,” said Marco Velazquez, 36, a history professor from Mexico City attending the annual celebration. “They’ve managed to do what the government said they couldn’t.”  Slideshow (19 Images)  And they can still muster large gatherings. To mark last year’s anniversary of the uprising, thousands of masked Zapatistas marched in silence across Chiapas.  Those close to the Zapatistas say the movement is as strong as ever, but has deliberately turned away from the limelight.  “They’ve turned inwards and they’re doing their own thing because they realized they weren’t going to get anywhere with the national system,” said Harry Cleaver, a retired economics professor at the University of Texas in Austin." }

Former U.S. President Bill Clinton administered the oath of office on a Bible once used by Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The formal midday service was held hours after De Blasio officially took office just after midnight on January 1 in a small ceremony at his home in Brooklyn.  He succeeds Michael Bloomberg, who led the city in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001 and the recession six years later, and whose policies have been credited with making the city safer, greener and more livable.  De Blasio, who captured more than 70 percent of the vote last November, presented himself as an anti-Bloomberg candidate, decrying the economic inequality that he said has emerged as New York shed its reputation from the 1970s and 1980s as a gritty and dangerous place.  Over the last decade, as the city prospered, apartment rents in New York City rose about 44 percent and the cost of a monthly Metro Card jumped 60 percent.  In his inaugural address, de Blasio adamantly underlined that message.  “When I said we would take dead aim at the tale of two cities, I meant it. And we will do it,” de Blasio said. “That mission - our march towards a fairer, more just, more progressive place, our march to keep the promise of New York alive for the next generation - it begins today.”  “We won’t wait. We’ll do it now,” de Blasio said as he ticked off his priorities: expanding the city’s paid sick leave law, forcing large developers to build more affordable housing, reforming the controversial police tactic of stop-and-frisk that critics say leads to racial profiling, and offering universal access to pre-kindergarten and after-school programs.  Indeed, his critics are likely to seize quickly on de Blasio’s ability to deliver on signature proposals.  New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio waves after taking the oath of office and making a speech at his formal inauguration ceremony on the steps of City Hall in New York January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Adrees Latif  His pre-kindergarten plan hinges on a tax hike for the city’s highest earners to pay for it that must be approved by state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo. Cooperation from Albany is far from assured.  HAVES AND HAVE-NOTS  Even beyond his ambitious, liberal agenda, de Blasio faces the day-to-day challenges of running a city of more than 8 million voters. He has just a few months to craft his first budget and his administration will be tasked with negotiating new contracts with each of the city’s public-sector unions, all of which have been working under long-expired terms.  A major winter storm is due to hit the city on Thursday, perhaps offering de Blasio his first major test.  But while Bloomberg often clashed with the City Council and with more liberal citywide officials, de Blasio will be surrounded by allies. The city’s new comptroller, Scott Stringer, and its new public advocate, Letitia James, both echoed de Blasio’s theme of confronting inequality.  “The growing gap between the haves and the have-nots undermines our city and tears at the fabric of our democracy,” said James, a former city councilwoman who is the first black woman to be elected to citywide office in New York City.  De Blasio began his career in government working under David Dinkins, the city’s first black mayor who was elected in 1986 and was the last Democrat to hold the post.  In 2000, when former U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton ran for U.S. senator in New York, de Blasio was her campaign manager.  He went on to serve two terms on the New York City Council and four years ago was elected public advocate - a citywide office with a budget of just $2 million that is generally seen as a springboard for the job of mayor.  Slideshow (5 Images)  Bloomberg, who is leaving City Hall after 12 years, has said he plans to take a two-week vacation in Hawaii and New Zealand with his longtime girlfriend, Diana Taylor.  Then, the billionaire, who has homes in Bermuda and London, has said he will focus on his charitable foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and remain active in public health, gun control and government innovation." }

The attacks on three police stations in Falluja, Ramadi and Tarmiya represent a serious escalation in the confrontation between Iraqi Sunni groups and the Shi’ite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.  Sunni anger at the government’s crushing of a protest movement has inflamed Iraq’s already deeply rooted sectarian tensions. The camp dismantled on Monday has been seen as an irritant to Maliki since it was set up to protest against perceived Sunni marginalization a year ago.  “Gunmen in large numbers surrounded the three police stations in Falluja and forced all policemen to leave without their weapons if they wanted to spare their lives. All of us left, we didn’t want to die for nothing,” a policeman stationed at one of the three stations told Reuters.  The gunmen then took control of a local government building nearby, deploying snipers on its roof to prevent the security forces from retaking command of the police stations in Falluja, 50 kilometers west of Baghdad.  Clashes between gunmen and security officials in Ramadi, another city in Anbar, continued for a third day on Wednesday, and also involved assaults on police stations by militants driving vehicles mounted with machine guns.  In a separate attack, at least four policemen were killed and 12 more wounded when gunmen attacked a police headquarters in the mainly Sunni town of Tarmiya, north of Baghdad, police reported.  Dozens of trucks loaded with gunmen were roaming the streets in Falluja and Anbar, and three police vehicles were set ablaze near one police station in Ramadi, a police source said.  The prime minister has offered some concessions to Sunni protesters, including proposed reforms to tough anti-terrorism laws, but most Sunni leaders say they will not be enough to appease the demonstrators.  The Shi’ite premier may also seek to consolidate his position before 2014 parliamentary elections by taking a tough stance against hardline Sunni Islamists.  More than 8,000 people have been killed in such violence this year.  Wednesday’s attacks began only hours after a decision by Anbar’s governor to lift a curfew imposed on Monday after fighting had erupted in various parts of the province.  Gunmen gesture during fighting in Ramadi January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Stringer  Maliki had said the civilian police force could resume control over Anbar’s security, but that decision was changed after an appeal by the province’s governor.  “The governor of Anbar Ahmed Khalaf appealed to the Prime Minister to keep the army in Anbar because al Qaeda fighters managed to enter on Wednesday and controlled some parts of the province,” the governor’s office told Reuters.  Violence in Iraq has hit its highest levels since the sectarian fighting of 2006-7, which killed tens of thousands of people." }

That reinforced views that while the world’s second-largest economy remains resilient, it lost some steam in late 2013.  Blue chip stocks underpinned Thursday’s gains. Top Australian bank the Commonwealth Bank of Australia rose 0.3 percent while National Australia Bank added 0.1 percent.  Telecommunications provider Telstra Corporation Ltd gained 0.2 percent, while retailer Woolworths Ltd climbed 0.4 percent.  Trading was subdued with 55.5 million shares trading hands by 0022 GMT, compared to the average daily trade of 678.7 million shares in 2013.  “The issue of low liquidity will still be prevalent and the full trading and investment community won’t be back in until next week, so there will be an element of money managers still using today to talk to clients,” said IG’s chief market strategist, Chris Weston, in a note to clients.  Mining stocks rose as operations at key ports in the resource-rich Pilbara region, crucial to major miners were returning to normal after the passing of Cyclone Christine.  Heavyweight iron ore miners BHP Billiton Ltd and Rio Tinto Ltd added 0.3 percent and 0.9 percent respectively.  Elsewhere, Buccaneer Energy Ltd slumped 17 percent to an all-time low of A$0.019 after it struck a deal with BlueCrest Energy Inc for the sale of its 25 percent interest in the Cosmopolitan Project, an Alaskan oil and gas field.  New Zealand’s stock exchanged was closed for a public holiday." }

Egypt has been hit by a wave of violent protests since the army removed elected Islamist President Mohamed Mursi from office in July following mass protests against his rule. Hundreds have been killed and thousands arrested since then.  The Interior Ministry said the clashes happened during two marches organized by some 200 Brotherhood members in Alexandria.  “They (the Brotherhood protesters) blocked the road... set shops on fire, burned a citizen’s car, fired guns and bird shot and clashed with and terrorized the people,” the Ministry of Interior said in a statement on Thursday.  It said some residents had exchanged fire with the Brotherhood protesters, killing two people and injured three police officers. The police forces managed to end the clashes and arrested 10, according to the Interior Ministry statement.  The police had earlier on Wednesday fired tear gas and water cannons at hundreds of pro-Mursi protesters demonstrating near the Defence Ministry in Cairo after they blocked a road and chanted anti-police and army slogans, according to state media reports.  Police also fired tear gas on pro-Mursi student protesters from the state’s main university in the Nile Delta city of Zakazik, the former president’s home town.  Students supporting Mursi have been staging daily protests inside and outside their universities since the start of a new academic year in September. At least 10 students have been killed during clashes with the police.  Last November, Egypt’s army-installed interim government issued a law that banned protests near or originating from places of worship and made it compulsory to seek Interior Ministry permission to hold a demonstration.  Since the law was passed, hundreds of Brotherhood protesters and liberal activists have been arrested for demonstrating without permission.  In the southern city of Beni Suef, an activist in the leftist Popular Current group was arrested and security forces confiscated his laptop computer, the movement said in a statement, identifying him as Mohamed Mostafa.  A police source said he was detained for posting anti-army and police comments on Facebook.  Since Mursi’s removal, which opened the bloodiest chapter in Egypt’s modern history, security forces have killed hundreds and arrested thousands of his supporters.  Some 400 soldiers and policemen also have been killed, many in attacks by Islamist militants in the Sinai Peninsula, bordering Israel and the Palestinian Gaza Strip.  On Monday, the United States expressed concern about Egypt’s designation of the Brotherhood as a terrorist group, as well as the ongoing detentions and arrests by security forces.  “We remain deeply concerned about all of the politically motivated arrests, detentions, and charges in Egypt. These actions raise questions about the rule of law being applied impartially and equitably, and do not move Egypt’s transition forward,” U.S. State Department spokeswoman Marie Harf said in Washington.  Mursi and most of the Brotherhood’s top leaders are on trial on a group of charges ranging from inciting violence against protesters to cooperating with foreign organization to execute terrorist acts in Egypt." }

Prime Minister David Cameron (L) speaks to first time buyers Kayleigh Groom (R) and her partner Chris Day during a visit to Weston Favell in Northampton, central England October 8, 2013. REUTERS/Rui Vieira/Pool  Presented by the government as a bold policy to help aspiring home-owners gain a foothold on the property ladder while stimulating house-building, the scheme has raised concerns among critics that it could fuel a property bubble.  “In less than three months, the scheme has already helped thousands of people. I want to see that continue in 2014 and for Help to Buy to help thousands more realize their dream of home ownership,” Cameron said in a statement.  British lenders provided 45,044 mortgages for home purchases in November, more than in any month since December 2009, data from the British Bankers Association showed last week.  The Bank of England, which collects fuller data about the British mortgage market, said in November that lenders had approved 67,701 mortgages in October, a six-year high, although still below the pre-crisis average of about 90,000.  The BoE in November unexpectedly said it was ending its own incentives for banks to provide mortgages as part of the separate Funding for Lending scheme, which would instead focus exclusively on lending to businesses.  BoE Governor Mark Carney warned in December that Britain’s housing market had a history of moving “from stall speed to warp speed”, and one of the BoE’s biggest challenges is keeping prices under control without holding back the rest of the economy.  The Bank and economists have also been concerned that the recovery relies too heavily on household consumption.  Data last month showed UK house prices rose 5.5 percent in the year to October, with London prices 12 percent higher.  Cameron and finance minister George Osborne, both from the Conservative Party which leads the coalition government, have dismissed concerns about Help to Buy, which they say helps people with sufficient incomes to meet monthly repayments but who cannot afford the hefty deposits demanded by banks.  But Business Secretary Vince Cable, of junior coalition partner the Liberal Democrats, said last week the government should review the scheme in light of changing circumstances since it was conceived.  Cable spoke of a boom in house prices which he warned risk making large parts of London affordable only for wealthy foreigners and bankers.  Barclays and Santander banks are expected to launch mortgage products supported by Help to Buy later this month, joining RBS and the Halifax unit of the Lloyds Banking Group that have been involved since the start, and other participating retail banks." }

The agreement, announced on Wednesday, cements Marchionne’s reputation as the industry’s consummate dealmaker about a decade after he took the helm of Fiat as a car business newcomer, analysts and bankers said.  But it remains to be seen whether a merger will be enough to cut Fiat’s losses in Europe. Marchionne’s plan to shore up Fiat depends on the ability to share technology, cash and dealer networks with Chrysler, the No. 3 U.S. automaker.  “This is an increasingly American company now, because in Europe, and especially in Italy, the business conditions remain difficult,” said Andrea Giuricin, transport analyst at Milan’s Bicocca University. “Fiat has already lost many of its market positions in Europe and it won’t be easy to recover that.”  Fiat will acquire the 41.46 percent stake in Chrysler it did not already own from a retiree healthcare trust affiliated with the United Auto Workers union. The trust, known as a voluntary employee beneficiary association or VEBA, will receive $3.65 billion in cash for the stake, $1.9 billion of which will come from Chrysler and $1.75 billion from Fiat. After the deal closes, Chrysler has committed to giving the UAW trust another $700 million over three years.  The deal is expected to close on or before Jan 20. Fiat said that because of how the deal is structured it will not need to make any capital increase through a rights issue.  The VEBA’s payout is less rich than some analysts expected. The sale of the UAW trust’s stake values the No. 3 U.S. automaker at less than $9 billion. When factoring in the additional $700 million, Chrysler is worth $10.5 billion.  “We thought they were going to have to pay a lot more than that,” a London-based analyst at a major investment bank said. “The market’s going to love this - Marchionne’s done it again. He’s brought in a deal that looks like a cracking one on the face of it and he doesn’t need to do a capital increase.”  ‘DEFINING MOMENT’  Marchionne, who has run both automakers since Chrysler’s 2009 U.S. government-funded bankruptcy restructuring, aims to merge Fiat and Chrysler into the world’s seventh-largest auto group.  But he has been at odds over the U.S. automaker’s worth with the trust, which was pushing for a payout of more than $5 billion. In September, the trust exercised an option enshrined in bankruptcy documents to force Chrysler to file for an initial public offering.  Wednesday’s deal will allow Chrysler to avoid an IPO.  In a statement, Marchionne called the buyout a defining moment for the two companies.  “The unified ownership structure will now allow us to fully execute our vision of creating a global automaker,” he said.  The Chrysler buyout talks have been closely watched by debt and equity investors as Fiat’s long-term plan to cut losses in Europe depends on its ability to deepen ties with Chrysler.  Chrysler is now a profit center for Fiat, but the two companies currently are forced to manage their finances separately. A full merger will make it easier - but not automatic - to combine the cash pools of the two companies, giving Fiat more funds to expand its product lineup.  The UAW trust was created in 2007 as a way for General Motors Co, Ford Motor Co and Chrysler to offload their obligations to pay retiree healthcare benefits.  Medical benefits for GM, Ford and Chrysler retirees are handled in separate accounts and each account was initially to be funded with cash. But during the 2009 financial crisis, the VEBA agreed to accept stakes in GM and Chrysler in lieu of cash." }

Over the next three months the NHL will play outdoor games from Los Angeles to New York featuring iconic franchises in historic settings in an unprecedented push to claim more ground in an escalating battle for a larger slice of the North American sporting landscape.  Emboldened by a new 12-year $5.2 billion Canadian television rights deal, labor peace and increasing talk of expansion, a bullish NHL commissioner Gary Bettman has embarked on what one sport marketing expert described as a campaign of “shock-and-awe”.  Putting the Winter Classic in ‘the Big House’ provided the “wow” factor the NHL was looking for to kickoff the New Year but it marked just the start of the league’s marketing blitz.  The Winter Classic will be followed by two games at Yankee Stadium later this month and another in Los Angeles before the NHL returns to the world’s biggest sporting stage at the Sochi Olympics.  Coming out of Russia the NHL will try to stay in the spotlight with outdoor contests in Vancouver and Chicago that the league hopes will add to the marketing momentum heading into the Stanley Cup playoffs.  “I hate to use military terms but this really is a sort of shock-and-awe campaign,” Paul Swangard, managing director, Warsaw Sports Marketing Center at the University of Oregon told Reuters. “We are going to have these incredible interesting outdoor experiences with a lot of interesting story lines, we are sending them to Sochi and all those athletes are going to come back and the casual fan gets exposed.”  SIGNATURE EVENT  In just six years the outdoor game that started as nothing more than a one-off novelty has grown into the league’s marketing centre piece, a New Year’s Day showcase that has eclipsed the Stanley Cup as the NHL’s signature event.  A concept that has captured the imagination of casual hockey fans, the appeal of the Winter Classic lies in game’s outdoor roots, anchored by romantic nostalgia and wintry charm.  The New Year’s Day Classic, however, has grown well beyond its initial sentimental appeal into big business, a cash cow for the league, teams and the city’s who have hosted them.  The Winter Classic was the main event in the week long hockey extravaganza that featured alumni games, junior and minor league hockey games played in Detroit at Comerica Park, home of Major League Baseball’s Tigers, pouring an estimated $60 million into the bankrupt city’s economy and another $15 million into Ann Arbor.  Four of the five most-watched NHL regular-season games in the U.S. since 1975 have been Winter Classics and Wednesday’s edition is almost certain to join that list.  “I think the week the NHL has put together here and at Comerica Park to sell our game is a great thing,” said Red Wings coach Mike Babcock. “It’s kind of like the Super Bowl setup in a way.  “This is an unbelievable event to sell hockey.”  KEEPING IT SPECIAL  The biggest challenge facing the NHL going forward is what to do for an encore while maintaining the uniqueness that has been part of its tremendous success.  Once coy about whether there would even be regular outdoor game, the league is no longer shy about its plans, having already confirmed next year’s Classic for Washington.  “They’ve been fun and successful and for the NHL to inject some fun into the sport and take it to a wider group of fans is almost priceless,” Robert Boland, chair of sports management at New York University’s Tisch Center told Reuters. “To some degree the Winter Classic games are ways to move fans from the more casual to more avid.  “The more you hold the less significant these events are and there is always a fine line that has to be walked.  “The NHL does have to make sure that these events have an exclusivity about them.”  With the staging of each outdoor game the NHL has raised the bar.  The first was played in 2008 in Buffalo in a Christmas card setting with the Pittsburgh Penguins’ Sidney Crosby netting the overtime winner as a steady snow fell, covering the sold-out crowd at Ralph Wilson Stadium with a white frosting.  The next two editions melded baseball and hockey tradition with the NHL staging the extravaganza in two of America’s most iconic sporting shrines, Chicago’s Wrigley Field and Boston’s Fenway Park.  The NHL’s two biggest names, Crosby and the Washington Capitals’ Alexander Ovechkin, faced off in 2011 while the New York Rangers and Philadelphia Flyers took their rivalry outdoors in 2012.  NHL chief operating officer John Collins, the mastermind and driving force behind the outdoor explosion, made it clear the Winter Classic is now a league fixture but was non-committal on the number of outdoor games that would be played each season in the future.  Slideshow (5 Images)  “I suspect the fact that this is all happening in the Olympic year is some reasoning behind the strategy that they are employing,” said Swangard. “I would be concerned if the six-pack model would be the every-year reality of a game that I think carries some uniqueness by its scarcity.  “The core fan base does need to expand, it is becoming increasingly competitive in the market place in a lot of NHL cities and these non-traditional ways that you can expose someone to the sport is a key part of the acquisition strategy.  “There is obviously going to be a real fine line there.”" }

The improvement comes despite unusually stormy British weather in the run-up to Christmas and a still-cautious approach by many consumers, sparking speculation that many retailers would struggle during the key holiday period.  John Lewis said on Thursday sales from online outlets and shops rose to 734 million pounds ($1.2 billion) in the five weeks to Dec. 28, including its biggest-ever taking of 35.6 million on day one of its in-store clearance sale on Dec. 27.  The increase contrasts with rival Debenhams, which kicked off the UK retail reporting period on Tuesday with a profit warning after a hoped-for surge in last-minute Christmas shopping failed to materialise despite heavy discounting.  John Lewis’s performance is the latest consumer endorsement for the employee-owned group, which has often outperformed competitors in recent years due to its strong online offering, modern stores and more affluent customer base.  The company also captured shoppers’ attention this year with an animated advertising campaign featuring a bear being woken from hibernation by an alarm clock gift, allowing it to appreciate a decorated Christmas tree for the first time.  Group like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, rose 6.9 percent.  TOUGH FESTIVE PERIOD  Elsewhere a profusion of shop window discount posters in recent days has illustrated retailers’ attempts to attract more customers in a tough market, made harder by a spell of gales and heavy rain which kept many shoppers at home. Research this month by accountants PwC found 72 of 100 town centre retailers were offering discounts or advertising promotions.  A decision by Britain’s biggest clothing retailer Marks & Spencer to slash 30 percent off all clothing prices in the Christmas build-up - the group’s first such move in five years - has raised fears it too has endured a tough festive period.  Next, Britain’s second-biggest clothing retailer, is due to publish a trading update on Friday, while M&S is due to report on Jan. 9.  Reflecting Britons’ increasing tendency to shop via their smartphones and tablets, John Lewis said online sales in the five weeks jumped 22.6 percent on a year ago and accounted for 31.8 percent of total sales in the period, helped by record online orders on “Black Friday” (Nov. 29), a U.S.-originated promotion day becoming more common in Britain.  Electrical and home technology sales rose 10.7 percent, while fashion and beauty increased 8.5 percent, the firm said.  “With new highs in branches as well as for johnlewis.com, this has been a genuine omni-channel Christmas,” Andy Street, managing director of John Lewis, said, adding the sales growth boded well for trading in 2014." }

Presented by the government as a bold policy to help aspiring home-owners gain a foothold on the property ladder while stimulating house-building, the scheme has raised concerns among critics that it could fuel a property bubble.  “In less than three months, the scheme has already helped thousands of people. I want to see that continue in 2014 and for Help to Buy to help thousands more realise their dream of home ownership,” Cameron said in a statement.  British lenders provided 45,044 mortgages for home purchases in November, more than in any month since December 2009, data from the British Bankers Association showed last week.  The Bank of England, which collects fuller data about the British mortgage market, said in November that lenders had approved 67,701 mortgages in October, a six-year high, although still below the pre-crisis average of about 90,000.  The BoE in November unexpectedly said it was ending its own incentives for banks to provide mortgages as part of the separate Funding for Lending scheme, which would instead focus exclusively on lending to businesses.  BoE Governor Mark Carney warned in December that Britain’s housing market had a history of moving “from stall speed to warp speed”, and one of the BoE’s biggest challenges is keeping prices under control without holding back the rest of the economy.  The Bank and economists have also been concerned that the recovery relies too heavily on household consumption.  Data last month showed UK house prices rose 5.5 percent in the year to October, with London prices 12 percent higher.  Cameron and finance minister George Osborne, both from the Conservative Party which leads the coalition government, have dismissed concerns about Help to Buy, which they say helps people with sufficient incomes to meet monthly repayments but who cannot afford the hefty deposits demanded by banks.  But Business Secretary Vince Cable, of junior coalition partner the Liberal Democrats, said last week the government should review the scheme in light of changing circumstances since it was conceived.  Cable spoke of a boom in house prices which he warned risk making large parts of London affordable only for wealthy foreigners and bankers.  Barclays and Santander banks are expected to launch mortgage products supported by Help to Buy later this month, joining RBS and the Halifax unit of the Lloyds Banking Group that have been involved since the start, and other participating retail banks." }

A total of nine candidates on lists for the constituencies Nara, Niono et Gao were affected, the court said late on Tuesday.  The dismissals did not change the overall outcome which granted a victory for President Ibrahim Boubacar Keita’s (IBK) RPM party, with 67 of a total 147 seats in Parliament.  Adema, the RPM’s main ally, finished second with 16 seats.  The confirmation of the final results is due to unlock $3.25 billion of donor pledges to rebuild the West African country after Islamists seized control of the north in the coup’s aftermath.  France sought to drive out the al Qaeda-linked fighters a year ago in a military intervention, helping to clear the way for elections.  Since his election in August, President Keita has struggled to exert control over the lawless northern region where some Islamic militants remain active and have launched attacks.  In the latest indication of the ongoing security challenges, two rockets were fired on Wednesday and landed next to the northern city of Kidal’s airport but failed to explode, according to a resident.  France has 2,800 troops stationed in Mali but aims to reduce its military presence to 1,000 by February as it hands security responsibilities to the Malian army and a U.N. force.

The early action was in currencies, where the yen resumed its long decline as investors used it to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets abroad.  The drop in the yen has been viewed as positive for Japanese exports and corporate earnings, and a major reason its share markets outperformed all others last year.  Japan's Nikkei .N225 will be closed on Thursday and Friday. The index ended 2013 with an annual gain of 57 percent, and many analysts look for a further advance this year as the Bank of Japan remains committed to its massive stimulus campaign.  Nomura’s global strategy team is forecasting that Japanese equities will provide the greatest return of all global stocks in 2014, thanks in large part to rising corporate earnings.  They see the Nikkei at 18,000 by the end of this year, up from the current 16,291, and said even 25,000 was possible by 2018 should Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s aggressive economic program prove successful in defeating deflation.  An office worker walks past the board of the Australian Securities Exchange building displaying its logo in central Sydney April 5, 2013. REUTERS/Daniel Munoz  Asian markets outside of Japan had a much more mixed performance in 2013, partly because investors rediscovered the attractions of assets in Europe and the United States.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan .MIAPJ0000PUS ended last year essentially flat, and early on Thursday it was off 0.15 percent.  Not helping was a drop in China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) to 51.0 in December, from 51.4 the previous month and below forecasts for 51.2.  Analysts at Barclays noted the pullback of activity in the survey was broadbased across industry sectors and sizes.  “Besides the need for deepening reforms and addressing structural issues such as reducing overcapacity and controlling local government debt, we think elevated interest rates across the money, bond and credit markets have led to higher funding costs, hurt corporate sentiment and thus weigh on economic growth,” they wrote in a client note.  They expected China’s central bank to maintain its tightening bias for a while yet.  Slideshow (4 Images)  HSBC and Markit release their measure of manufacturing activity later on Thursday and that has also been pointing to some slowdown in growth.  A whole slew of manufacturing indices for Europe and the U.S. are due out across Thursday which will offer a better idea of how global industry was faring into the end of the year.  Markets reacted to the China data by knocking the Australian dollar down a quarter of a U.S. cent. China is Australia’s single biggest export market and the currency is often used as a liquid proxy for risk in the Asian giant.  For other major currencies the main themes continued to be weakness in the yen and resilience in the euro.  The single currency was up at 144.97 yen having clocked up gains of 26 percent over 2013 to reach a five-year peak of 145.67. The dollar was likewise firm at 105.38 yen having climbed 21 percent last year.  The euro was a shade softer on the dollar at $1.3754, but still not far from its recent two-year peak of $1.3892.  Dealers suspect the single currency has been supported by the repatriation of funds by European banks and a large and expanding current account surplus in the euro zone.  But there remains a general assumption rising U.S. Treasury yields will eventually lift the dollar up on the euro. Yields on U.S. 10-year paper are up at two-and-a-half year highs of 3.03 percent. Even shorter-dated rates have been rising as improving U.S. economic data justifies the Federal Reserve’s decision to start tapering its asset-buying stimulus.  Outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is giving a speech on Friday and may offer more guidance on the outlook for tapering.  In commodity markets, gold remained on the defensive at $1,204.49 an ounce, having suffered its biggest annual loss in three decades last year.

Mandatory Credit: Rick Osentoski-USA TODAY Sports  An announced record hockey crowd of 105,491 braved brutal Arctic conditions to fill the massive Michigan Stadium in Ann Arbor and were left on the edge on the edge of their frozen seats until the Leafs’ Tyler Bozak scored the decisive shootout goal in the fading light and blowing snow.  If confirmed, the crowd would be the biggest ever for a hockey game surpassing the 104,173 set when Michigan State and Michigan met in 2010 at the same stadium dubbed ‘The Big House’.  Guinness world record officials were on hand but were not immediately able to confirm the record.  The previous highest NHL attendance came at the first Winter Classic in 2008 in snowy Buffalo when the Sabres and Pittsburgh Penguins faced off in front of a crowd at 71,217 to Ralph Wilson Stadium.  “We know we sold 105,000 plus tickets and we also suspect there were some no shows because we heard stories of people taking more than two and a half hours to get here because of the road conditions,” NHL commissioner Gary Bettman told reporters. “It was 13 degrees with a wind chill of minus-1 so I don’t know if we set the Guinness attendance record but we set our own record.  “Based on tickets sold we should have (the record) but people were still arriving in the second period so it is hard to know.”  The sixth Winter Classic was played in a blizzard as snow swirled around stadium and temperatures plunged to minus 13 Celsius (13 Fahrenheit).  Play was halted several times to clear the ice while two Zambonis were used the entire intermissions, unable to clean the surface fast enough before snow reappeared.  The bitter cold, however, could not spoil the party atmosphere, the snow only adding to the romantic imagery that has been a big part of the outdoor game’s huge appeal.  “We couldn’t be more pleased the way things went, the crowd was extraordinary, over 100,000 people braved the elements first to get here and then sit outside,” beamed Bettman.  This year’s Classic was the main event in the week long hockey extravaganza that featured alumni games, junior and minor league hockey games played in Detroit at Comerica Park, home of Major League Baseball’s Tigers, pouring an estimated $60 million into the bankrupt city and another $15 million into Ann Arbor’s economy.  While the Winter Classic was more about the event than the game for many fans, for the two struggling teams the game was more than an outdoor spectacle with two valuable points on offer.  The Original Six rivals came into the contest sitting on 45 points in the Eastern conference standings looking to tighten their grip on a playoff position.  Following a scoreless opening period the players headed for the warmth of the locker rooms while shivering fans ran for the concourse seeking shelter from the wind and snow.  Slideshow (2 Images)  Detroit broke the deadlock late in the second period when Henrik Zetterberg’s centering pass deflected in off the skate of a charging Daniel Alfredsson, triggering a mighty roar from the chilled crowd.  The Maple Leafs tied the score with just 37 seconds remaining in the period when James van Riemsdyk banged home a rebound from the side of the Detroit net.  Toronto took its first lead five minutes into the third when Bozak redirected Dion Phaneuf’s shot from the point past Jimmy Howard before Justin Abdelkader hit back for the Wings forcing overtime." }

Now thousands of tourists and sympathizers come here every year to drink mojitos at a bar called Revolucion, visit nearby Zapatista communities with masked guides, and pick up souvenirs emblazoned with the image of Subcomandante Marcos, who thrilled leftists across the globe and won comparisons with Che Guevara.  Twenty years after Marcos led armed indigenous insurgents in Chiapas state in a “declaration of war” against the government the day Mexico opened its borders to free trade, the Zapatistas have faded from national view and their legacy is in question.  Named for Mexican revolutionary hero Emiliano Zapata, the Zapatista National Liberation Army sparked a 12-day battle with the Army that claimed at least 140 lives, becoming an early symbol for supporters of the anti-globalization movement.  Today Chiapas remains Mexico’s poorest state, and Marcos, the Zapatistas’ masked poet leader, has all but disappeared.  Skilled in courting publicity, the pipe-smoking Marcos has not made any major public appearance since 2006, when he rode across Mexico on horseback to condemn its political class. He banned all media from the 20th anniversary celebrations.  “It’s December 2013. It’s just as cold as it was 20 years ago, and today, like back then, the same flag protects us: that of rebellion,” Marcos wrote in a 3,000-word communique published this week that railed against President Enrique Pena Nieto, his predecessor Felipe Calderon, and the “paid press.”  The Zapatistas brought to prominence the plight of the region’s impoverished Maya Indians, who were once so ostracized that they could not even walk on San Cristobal’s sidewalks.  But while money has flowed in from the government and private donors, many of the Zapatistas’ demands, especially for reform to grant the movement autonomy, have not been met.  In 2001, Congress passed legislation to give the indigenous more rights. But it was not enough for the Zapatistas, who set up their own autonomous justice, health and education systems in five municipalities in Chiapas known as caracoles, or shells.  In a visit granted to Reuters reporters in the Zapatista community of Oventic, the atmosphere was cheerful.  The gates were decorated with flowered wreaths, music played as footage of the Mexican army’s strike showed on televisions, and stalls sold revolutionary T-shirts and Zapatista figurines.  Murals honored the movement’s namesake and spelled out slogans like “Slow, but we’re advancing.” But every request to interview or photograph Zapatistas was denied by a community spokesman, who later forced the reporters to leave.  By contrast, hundreds of camera-toting fans were allowed in: coach buses crammed the narrow, mountainous road to Oventic, bringing visitors from as far away as France and Italy eager to participate in the Zapatista experience and buy trinkets.  ECONOMIC LIBERALISM  Neil Harvey, a New Mexico State University professor and author of “The Chiapas Rebellion,” estimates about 150,000 people live in the Zapatista communities, where indigenous leaders have raised living standards, including outlawing alcohol, improving women’s rights and creating Maya language schools.  “There is this existence of two authorities in Chiapas,” Harvey said. “Legally, it’s still not recognized by the Mexican government, but politically it’s tolerated.”  Still, more than three-quarters of Chiapas, which has one of Mexico’s largest indigenous populations, lives in poverty.  That compares with about half the Mexican population, which is little changed from when then-President Carlos Salinas signed up to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) that came into force the day of the rebellion on Jan. 1, 1994.  NAFTA was a major challenge to the Maya because it gave private investors the chance to buy land formerly in communal hands, and the Zapatistas declared it a “death sentence.”  But the economy has continued to open up ever since.  Last month Pena Nieto got a bill passed end Mexico’s 75-year-old oil and gas monopoly, in a move some analysts hailed as the biggest reform of the Mexican economy since NAFTA.  Marcos rejects claims the Zapatistas have failed, saying in his communique that interest in the group proves its relevance.  There is no doubting the fervor of supporters.  “The Zapatistas changed my life and opened my eyes politically,” said Marco Velazquez, 36, a history professor from Mexico City attending the annual celebration. “They’ve managed to do what the government said they couldn’t.”  And they can still muster large gatherings. To mark last year’s anniversary of the uprising, thousands of masked Zapatistas marched in silence across Chiapas.  Those close to the Zapatistas say the movement is as strong as ever, but has deliberately turned away from the limelight.  “They’ve turned inwards and they’re doing their own thing because they realized they weren’t going to get anywhere with the national system,” said Harry Cleaver, a retired economics professor at the University of Texas in Austin.

The cost overruns on the $3.2 billion canal extension, one of the world’s largest construction contracts, should be met by the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) under the terms of the contract, argued the consortium comprised of Spain’s Sacyr, Italy’s Impregilo, Belgium’s Jan De Nul and Panama’s Constructora Urbana, SA.  However, the PCA rejected the complaints by the consortium, known as Grupo Unidos por el Canal.  “Regardless of what kind of pressure is put on the PCA, we will maintain our demand that Grupo Unidos por el Canal respects the contract that they themselves accepted and signed,” the head of the PCA, Jorge Quijano, said in a statement.  The PCA added that if the consortium was not capable of honoring its agreements, the authority would initiate “mechanisms from the contract that would allow the work to be completed.” It did not explain what those would be.  The consortium said the overruns were the result of unforeseen events during construction, something which was “normal” in these kind of projects.  The group said it believes the PCA had “failed in its obligations as set out in the contract as well as in the inexactitude of the information provided to the consortium to carry out the project.”  Under the terms agreed, the PCA has another 21 days to comply with the requirements, it added, during which work will continue.  No one at Sacyr was immediately available for further comment.  Problems with the Panama project come at a bad time for Sacyr, whose total net debt stood at 6.9 billion euros at the end of September, more than three times its market capitalisation." }

The early action was in currencies, where the yen resumed its long decline as investors used it to fund purchases of higher-yielding assets abroad.  The drop in the yen has been viewed as positive for Japanese exports and corporate earnings, and a major reason its share markets outperformed all others last year.  Japan’s Nikkei will be closed on Thursday and Friday. The index ended 2013 with an annual gain of 57 percent, and many analysts look for a further advance this year as the Bank of Japan remains committed to its massive stimulus campaign.  Nomura’s global strategy team is forecasting that Japanese equities will provide the greatest return of all global stocks in 2014, thanks in large part to rising corporate earnings.  They see the Nikkei at 18,000 by the end of this year, up from the current 16,291, and said even 25,000 was possible by 2018 should Prime Minister Shinzo Abe’s aggressive economic program prove successful in defeating deflation.  Asian markets outside of Japan had a much more mixed performance in 2013, partly because investors rediscovered the attractions of assets in Europe and the United States.  MSCI’s broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan ended last year essentially flat, and early on Thursday it was off 0.15 percent.  Not helping was a drop in China’s official Purchasing Managers’ Index (PMI) to 51.0 in December, from 51.4 the previous month and below forecasts for 51.2.  Analysts at Barclays noted the pullback of activity in the survey was broadbased across industry sectors and sizes.  “Besides the need for deepening reforms and addressing structural issues such as reducing overcapacity and controlling local government debt, we think elevated interest rates across the money, bond and credit markets have led to higher funding costs, hurt corporate sentiment and thus weigh on economic growth,” they wrote in a client note.  They expected China’s central bank to maintain its tightening bias for a while yet.  HSBC and Markit release their measure of manufacturing activity later on Thursday and that has also been pointing to some slowdown in growth.  A whole slew of manufacturing indices for Europe and the U.S. are due out across Thursday which will offer a better idea of how global industry was faring into the end of the year.  Markets reacted to the China data by knocking the Australian dollar down a quarter of a U.S. cent. China is Australia’s single biggest export market and the currency is often used as a liquid proxy for risk in the Asian giant.  For other major currencies the main themes continued to be weakness in the yen and resilience in the euro.  The single currency was up at 144.97 yen having clocked up gains of 26 percent over 2013 to reach a five-year peak of 145.67. The dollar was likewise firm at 105.38 yen having climbed 21 percent last year.  The euro was a shade softer on the dollar at $1.3754, but still not far from its recent two-year peak of $1.3892.  Dealers suspect the single currency has been supported by the repatriation of funds by European banks and a large and expanding current account surplus in the euro zone.  But there remains a general assumption rising U.S. Treasury yields will eventually lift the dollar up on the euro. Yields on U.S. 10-year paper are up at two-and-a-half year highs of 3.03 percent. Even shorter-dated rates have been rising as improving U.S. economic data justifies the Federal Reserve’s decision to start tapering its asset-buying stimulus.  Outgoing Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke is giving a speech on Friday and may offer more guidance on the outlook for tapering.  In commodity markets, gold remained on the defensive at $1,204.49 an ounce, having suffered its biggest annual loss in three decades last year.  U.S. oil Futures were trading 28 cents higher on Thursday at $98.67 a barrel." }

Now the company wants to spend $16 million to convert the terminal to ship coal.  A worker levels the iron ore in a freight train at a railway station at Chitradurga in the southern Indian state of Karnataka in this November 9, 2012 file photo. REUTERS/Danish Siddiqui/Files  Bans on iron ore mining and exports in India’s top producing states of Karnataka and Goa have choked the industry so hard that MMTC is one of many firms exiting. Even if efforts to fully lift the bans make it past the many bureaucratic and legal hurdles, iron ore miners do not expect complete resumption of production until late 2014.  The bans, put in place as the government tried to clamp down on illegal mining, have cut India’s iron ore exports by around 85 percent, or 100 million tonnes, over the past two years. They have also reduced foreign exchange earnings by more than $17 billion in the same period, according to the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI).  The structural shift in India’s iron ore industry could be a blessing for other suppliers, as demand growth from top market China slows and Australian miners Rio Tinto (RIO.AX) and BHP Billiton (BHP.AX) ramp up output. It will also make it harder for India to regain its spot as the world’s No.3 exporter of the steelmaking raw material.  “It’s pretty evident that there’s lasting damage to the industry,” said R. K. Bansal, a secretary general at FIMI. “But if the government of the day at the state and central level, as well as other authorities, stick their neck out and take decisions then this paralysis can go.”  Mining in Goa was banned in September 2012, freezing shipments that reached about 50 million tonnes in the 2010-11 fiscal year. In neighboring Karnataka, where the ban started in 2011, exports remain frozen even though it was lifted in April. In both states, the bulk of mining was done by private companies, which were accused of mining outside lease areas and in excess of set limits.  MMTC was banking on business from Karnataka when it invested along with Indian partners Sical Logistics Ltd (SICA.NS) and L&T Infrastructure Development Projects in an iron ore terminal in Ennore Port in the southern Tamil Nadu state.  “We think that at least in the next five to six years there will be no exports of iron ore,” said SM Babu, general manager at MMTC’s Chennai office. Instead the joint venture company hopes to tap growing demand for coal-fired power plants in Tamil Nadu.  Only 16 out of 115 mines have resumed mining in Karnataka. For those keen on returning, the bureaucratic hurdles can be overwhelming.  “There are about 30 or 40 companies whose quantities are so low that they will never restart,” said Basant Poddar, owner of Mineral Enterprises Ltd, which has four mining leases in Karnataka but none operating currently.  “For those willing, the issue is with forest clearances. The whole process goes through about 50 levels or officers for stage one clearance, and for stage two it’s cut down to about 20.”  On Monday, Vedanta Resources Plc VED.L, a London-based mining conglomerate controlled by Indian tycoon Anil Agarwal, said its Sesa Sterlite SESA.NS unit had resumed operations in Karnataka after clearance from a court-appointed panel.  CHINA APPETITE WANING  Jiro Iokibe, analyst at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, sees Indian iron ore exports of 15 million tonnes next year, rising to 20 million tonnes in 2015. This is well below the record of more than 117 million tonnes in 2009-2010.  Lower Indian supply has eased pressure on a market seen moving to surplus given expansion by low-cost producers such as Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Brazil’s Vale VALE5.SA while growth in Chinese demand eases.  India’s exports to China reached just over 10 million tonnes in January-November, down 68 percent from a year earlier.

REUTERS/Mukesh Gupta/Files  <MTL/CHINA3>  “Definitely people are not depending now on Indian material,” said a trader in Shanghai who is among a few left selling only Indian iron ore to Chinese mills. “Most traders have switched to mainstream cargoes from Australia and Brazil and cargoes from India are going at a discount of maybe up to $4 a tonne.”  India’s central and state governments, which put in place the various bans under direction from a Supreme Court determined to clamp down on illegal mining, appear keen on getting the iron ore sector back on its feet.  “We have placed all the regulatory measures we have undertaken in front of the Supreme Court so that we can resume mining operations,” Prasanna Acharya, mines director in Goa, said in November.  The court has set up a panel that will determine a limit on Goa’s production. The panel is expected to submit an interim report by February 15, but Acharya has said he does not expect a resumption in mining before October at the earliest.  COLLATERAL DAMAGE  When the iron ore miners give up, so do businesses relying on the raw material.  Out of the 53 sponge iron making plants in Karnataka with annual production capacity of about 3 million tonnes, 19 have closed and 27 are operating at half their capacity due to a shortage of iron ore, said Deependra Kashiva, executive director of the Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association.  India is the world’s top producer of sponge iron, an alternative steelmaking ingredient that is economically viable where natural gas is abundant and cheap.  At Sesa Sterlite’s 7 million-tonnes-per-year mine in Codli Village, about 50 kilometers east of Goa’s capital Panaji, machinery operator Lakshdeep Asrekar is among a few who still report to work.  Asrekar is lucky because many have lost their jobs, with industry group FIMI estimating job cuts at 200,000 across Goa and Karnataka.  “We come and start our machinery and dumpers and keep them running for 15-20 minutes so that they are in working condition,” said Asrekar." }

The mining and export bans in the key states of Goa and Karnataka have brought miners and other businesses to their knees, forced steelmakers to buy iron ore abroad and seen hundreds of thousands laid off.  Following is a timeline of key developments in India’s iron ore sector since Karnataka introduced its shipments ban:  2010 July 26 - Karnataka state, governed by the opposition Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, bans shipments of iron ore. The state government had faced pressure from the ruling Congress-led federal government to clamp down on illegal mining. Exporters in the state subsequently challenged the ban.  September - Iron ore exports post their sharpest monthly fall in nearly two years after the ban on Karnataka, dropping 47 percent from a year earlier to 3.03 million tonnes.  November 19 - Karnataka’s high court upholds the ban on shipments. State governments can decide on shipments or movements of resources, but only the federal government can agree a ban on exports.  2011 January 25 - India’s state-owned railways announce an increase in freight costs on iron ore for export of 50 percent to 1,500 rupees ($24) per tonne.  February 28 - India hikes export duties on iron ore to 20 percent from 5 percent for fines and from 15 percent for lumps in its annual budget.  March 3 - Freight rates are hiked again, this time by 100 rupees per tonne to 1,600 rupees.  March 30 - Indian Railways says it will impose a “busy season” charge of 7 percent on iron ore freight rates from April 1 to June 30 and from October 1 to March 31. The charge was estimated to equate to about 150-200 rupees per tonne.  April 5 - The Supreme Court orders Karnataka state to lift its ban on iron ore shipments from April 20.  June 27 - Iron ore exporter Mineral Enterprises Ltd says it will ask the Supreme Court to uphold the lifting of the Karnataka ban, which has been delayed by an inquiry into illegal mining.  July 27 - An independent inquiry implicates B.S. Yediyurappa, a prominent Indian opposition politician and chief minister of Karnataka, in a $3.6 billion illegal iron ore mining scandal.  July 29 - The Supreme Court imposes an interim ban on mining in the district of Bellary, an iron-ore rich region in Karnataka, on concerns over environment degradation.  July 31 - Yediyurappa resigns as Karnataka chief minister.  August 5 - The Supreme Court partially lifts the iron ore mining ban in Bellary district, allowing state-run NMDC (NMDC.NS) to mine up to 1 million tonnes a month from August 6.  August 26 - The top court expands the mining ban to Tumkur and Chitradurga, two districts in Karnataka.  December 12 - India’s top iron ore producing state, Odisha, stops issuing export permits for iron ore cargoes shipped via two small ports, Gangavaram and Kakinada.  December 30 - India hikes export duties on iron ore fines and lumps to 30 percent.  2012 April 20 - The top court partially allows the restart of Category A mines or mines of more than 50 hectares in Karnataka.  September 3 - The top court allows 18 mines to resume iron ore mining in Karnataka state after a suspension of over a year.  September 11 - The state of Goa halts iron ore mining after an expert panel formed by the federal government found “serious illegalities and irregularities” in mining operations.  September 12 - Following the mining ban, India suspends environmental clearances given to 93 iron ore mines in Goa.  October 5 - India’s Supreme Court suspends iron ore transport in Goa.  November 7 - Tata Steel (TISC.NS), India’s largest private steelmaker, says it expects to amicably resolve the issue of a large fine imposed by the Odisha government for failing to stick to mining norms in the state. Media reports said the Odisha government has fined Tata Steel and other firms for exceeding the annual limit on iron ore extraction from its mines in the state.  2013 April 18 - India’s Supreme Court gives conditional go-ahead to mining in Karnataka but strips about 49 mines of their leases because they had been mining illegally.  November 11 - Supreme Court maintains ban on iron ore mining in Goa but allows the sale of 11.46 million tonnes of material that sat in stockpiles. ($1 = 61.9750 Indian rupees)" }

Critics say anticipated social harms of legalization, from declines in economic productivity to a rise in traffic and workplace accidents, outweigh any benefits.  They also warn that legalizing recreational use could help create an industry intent on attracting underage users and getting more people dependent on the drug.  Cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law, though the Obama administration has said it will give individual states leeway to carry out their own recreational-use statutes.  Nearly 20 states, including Colorado and Washington, had already put themselves at odds with the U.S. government by approving marijuana for medical purposes.  Comparing the nascent pot market to the alcohol industry, former U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy, co-founder of Project Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said his group aims to curtail marijuana advertising and to help push local bans on the drug while the industry is still modest in stature.  Slideshow (24 Images)  “This is a battle that if we catch it early enough we can prevent some of the most egregious adverse impacts that have happened as a result of the commercialized market that promotes alcohol use to young people,” he said.  Under Colorado law, however, state residents can buy as much as an ounce (28 grams) of marijuana at a time, while out-of-state visitors are restricted to quarter-ounce purchases.  Restraint was certainly the message being propagated on New Year’s Eve by Colorado authorities, who posted signs at Denver International Airport and elsewhere around the capital warning that pot shops can only operate during approved hours, and that open, public consumption of marijuana remains illegal." }

Nearly 20 states, including Colorado and Washington, had already put themselves at odds with the U.S. government by approving marijuana for medical purposes.  Comparing the nascent pot market to the alcohol industry, former U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy, co-founder of Project Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said his group aims to curtail marijuana advertising and to help push local bans on the drug while the industry is still modest in stature.  “This is a battle that if we catch it early enough we can prevent some of the most egregious adverse impacts that have happened as a result of the commercialized market that promotes alcohol use to young people,” he said.  Under Colorado law, however, state residents can buy as much as an ounce (28 grams) of marijuana at a time, while out-of-state visitors are restricted to quarter-ounce purchases.  Restraint was certainly the message being propagated on New Year’s Eve by Colorado authorities, who posted signs at Denver International Airport and elsewhere around the capital warning that pot shops can only operate during approved hours, and that open, public consumption of marijuana remains illegal.

Soldiers assess the scene of an explosion outside the Jazira hotel in Mogadishu, January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Feisal Omar  The attacks on the Jazira hotel, one of the securest places in Mogadishu, underscore the security challenges facing President Hassan Sheikh Mohamud, whose election by lawmakers last year was hailed by many as a way to end two decades of conflict.  The first two bombs came in quick succession and were followed by heavy bursts of gunfire by Somali security forces. The third blast took place about an hour later when a bomb went off inside a car that was being searched by the military.  At least one of the first two bombs appeared to be a suicide bomber, police said.  There was no immediate claim of responsibility but the Islamist rebel group al Shabaab has carried out a campaign of attacks over the past two and a half years in Mogadishu.  “First we heard a big crash and the security forces immediately opened fire,” said Abdullahi Hussein who lives 300 meters behind the hotel. “After a few minutes another explosion took place and there was more gunfire.”  Abdikadir Abdirahman, the director of a private ambulance service, told Reuters at least 11 people had been killed and 17 others were wounded.  The attack will be an embarrassment to the government whose survival depends heavily on a near 18,000-strong African peacekeeping force. Donors pump in hundreds of millions of dollars into the Horn of Africa country every year to provide basic services.  “This year, 2014 is going to be the strengthening of Somali forces and the elimination of the extremists,” the newly appointed Prime Minister Abdiweli Sheikh Ahmed said in a statement on Wednesday.  The African forces helped drive al Shabaab out of the capital in August 2011, as well as other major urban centers, but the militants still hold sway over swathes of rural areas.  Islamist suicide bombers attacked the Jazira hotel in September last year as Mohamud was giving a news conference just two days into the job. He and the visiting Kenyan foreign minister were unhurt in that assault.  An attack on Kenyan shopping mall in September that killed dozens of people highlighted the militants’ ability to strike beyond Somalia’s borders." }

Vehicles travel north from San Diego to Los Angeles along Interstate Highway 5 in California December 10, 2013. REUTERS/Mike Blake  Even experienced drivers face a dangerously-high risk of getting into an accident while manipulating a cell phone.  Those are some of the findings from a newly-released study that monitored 151 licensed U.S. drivers - 42 novices and 109 experienced drivers - to log what they were doing just before an accident or a near-miss.  The most controversial element of the study is expected to be another finding: The act of just talking on a cell phone didn’t increase the risk of a crash, regardless of a driver’s experience.  Instead, it turns out the things that allow a driver to talk - such as dialing or reaching to get to a ringing phone - posed the real danger.  And those hazards were even greater than the risk posed by texting or using the Internet while driving.  “At least for novice teenage drivers, secondary tasks that take the eyes off the road pose a very high risk for crash,” co-author Bruce Simons-Morton, a senior investigator at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.  “It’s true for adults too, but they seem to be better than novices at dividing their attention. They attend to tasks and look back up at the roadway without taking a long period of time,” he said.  “Talking on a cell phone does not require the driver to look away from the road ahead,” they said. “However, our findings should not be interpreted to suggest that there is no risk associated with this activity, since previous simulation and test-track research has shown that talking on a cell phone reduces attention to visible road hazards and degrades driving performance.”  “It worries me that people will read this and proclaim that talking and driving is now safe,” Dr. Amy Ship of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Harvard Medical School told Reuters Health by phone. She was not connected with the research.  Ship said she was surprised to see the risk of talking was so low, but asserted that more evidence is needed, especially when other studies have shown that just the act of talking on the phone is hazardous. “It’s 280 million people talking and driving, so the risk is still huge, and it’s an avoidable risk.”  The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, confirms the danger of texting while driving, which is banned in many places. But it only looked at texting among novice drivers, whose actions were recorded for 18 months during 2006 to 2008.  The team, led by Shelia Klauer of the Virgina Tech Transportation Institute in Blacksburg, Virginia, did not gauge the texting risk for the experienced drivers because those data were collected for 12 months for each driver in 2003 and 2004, before texting became so popular.  The car of each driver was equipped with forward radar, a GPS, a lane tracker, a device that measures acceleration and four cameras, two of which showed what the driver was doing. Sudden movements of the car helped to indicate crashes and near-crashes.  None of the crashes during the study involved serious injury.  “This is the first study where we actually saw what they did to look at objective measures of distraction,” said Simons-Morton.  In all, there were 685 crashes and near-crashes for which the driver shared the blame. The findings clearly showed that maturity mattered.  For experienced drivers, reaching for an object, or eating or drinking a nonalcoholic beverage while driving did not increase the risk of a crash - at least not enough to be statistically significant.  Yet dialing a cell phone was clearly a problem for the veterans. Their odds of a crash or near-crash jumped 2.5-fold as they tried to make a call.  But for novices who had been driving for 19 months or less, a lot of distracting activities interfered with their abilities.  The chance of having an accident or near-accident was 8.3 times higher while dialing a cell phone, 8.0 times greater while reaching for an object other than a cell phone, 7.1 times higher while just reaching for a cell phone, 3.9 times greater while sending or receiving a text message and 3.0 times greater when eating while driving.  Only drinking a nonalcoholic beverage, adjusting controls for the radio or heating system or talking on the cell phone didn’t increase the risk for the novices.  Although young adults ages 15 to 20 years old account for 6.4 percent of all U.S. drivers, they are responsible for 10 percent of all motor vehicle traffic deaths and 14 percent of all crashes that result in injury.  About 9 percent of all drivers use their phone while on the road and their risk of a crash is four times higher than other drivers.  “It’s clear that if we’re going to target drivers, novice drivers and younger drivers are at highest risk for a whole variety of reason,” Ship said.  “They’re at higher risk independent of distracted driving, they’re inexperienced and they have no sense of the risks associated with anything they’re doing, on the road or otherwise. You take that trifecta and apply that to something that weighs two tons and moves quickly down the highway, it’s a recipe for disaster.”  SOURCE: bit.ly/19F1LID New England Journal of Medicine, online January 1, 2014." }

A shopkeeper reaches for a packet of cigarettes in a newsagent in London November 28, 2013. REUTERS/Suzanne Plunkett  In a review in the New England Journal of Medicine, scientists from the charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) said hiking taxes by a large amount per cigarette would encourage people to quit smoking altogether rather than switch to cheaper brands, and help stop young people from taking up the habit.  As well as causing lung cancer, which is often fatal, smoking is the largest cause of premature death from chronic conditions like heart disease, stroke and high blood pressure.  Tobacco kills around 6 million people a year now, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), and that toll is expected to rise above 8 million a year by 2030 if nothing is done to curb smoking rates.  Richard Peto, an epidemiologist at CRUK who led the study, said aggressively increasing tobacco taxes would be especially effective in poorer and middle-income countries where the cheapest cigarettes are relatively affordable.  Of the 1.3 billion people around the world who smoke, most live in poorer countries where often governments have also not yet introduced smoke-free legislation.  But increasing tobacco tax would also be effective in richer countries, Peto said, citing evidence from France, which he said halved cigarette consumption from 1990 to 2005 by raising taxes well above inflation.  “The two certainties in life are death and taxes. We want higher tobacco taxes and fewer tobacco deaths,” he said in a statement. “It would help children not to start, and it would help many adults to stop while there’s still time.”  While smokers lose at least 10 years of life, quitting before age 40 avoids more than 90 percent of the increased health risk run by people who continue smoking. Stopping before age 30 avoids more than 97 percent of the risk.  Governments around the world have agreed to prioritize reducing premature deaths from cancer and other chronic diseases in the United Nations General Assembly and in the WHO’s World Health Assembly in 2013. They also agreed to a target of reducing smoking by a third by 2025.  The CRUK analysis found that doubling the price of cigarettes in the next decade through increased taxes would cut worldwide consumption by about a third by that target, and at the same time increase annual government revenues from tobacco by a third from around $300 billion to $400 billion.  This extra income, the researchers suggested, could be spent on boosting health care budgets.  Peto noted that the international tobacco industry makes about $50 billion in profits each year, saying this equated to “approximately $10,000 per death from smoking”.  “Worldwide, around half a billion children and adults under the age of 35 are already - or soon will be - smokers, and many will be hooked on tobacco for life. So there’s an urgent need for governments to find ways to stop people starting and to help smokers give up,” said Harpal Kumar, CRUK’s chief executive.  He said the study, which examined 63 research papers on the causes and consequences of tobacco use in many different countries, showed tobacco taxes are “a hugely powerful lever”.  They are also potentially a triple win, Kumar said, cutting the number of people who smoke and die from their addiction, reducing the health care burden and costs linked to smoking and at the same time increasing government income." }

Hill put the game away in the final minutes with runs of 28, 20 and 37 yards, the last a touchdown to cap a 92-yard drive that gave the Tigers a 21-7 lead.  “If you give Jeremy Hill an opportunity to close out a victory, he knows what that means,” LSU coach Les Miles said. “He really put the finishing touches on that Iowa team and this game.”  Held to 165 yards of total offense with 10 minutes remaining, Iowa had a chance to tie in the fourth quarter after freshman quarterback C.J. Beathard connected with tight end Jake Duzey for a 35-yard gain to the LSU 25. Facing a fourth-and-1 at the 16, Iowa called a rollout for Beathard, whose pass was intercepted by LSU safety Craig Loston with 5:04 remaining.  From there, Hill helped put the game away, running for 28 and 20 yards on back-to-back carries to move the ball into Iowa territory as the clock ticked away. On a third-and-6 play, he broke through the Iowa defense for his second touchdown.  “We didn’t really reach our expectations, but we still have a lot to play for,” Hill said. “We knew we had to go out with a bang. ... We had fun in practice, did what we were supposed to do and it really showed out there in the emotions and energy we played with.”  Iowa scored again late, getting a 96-yard kickoff return from wide receiver Jordan Cotton to the LSU 4-yard line. Two plays later, Beathard threw a touchdown pass to wide receiver Kevonte Martin-Manley, pulling the Hawkeyes again within a touchdown at 21-14 with 1:42 to play.  Iowa’s onside kick was recovered by LSU’s Connor Neighbors to clinch the win. The Hawkeyes’ touchdown drives were 1 and 4 yards. Iowa coach Kirk Ferentz saw parallels in LSU’s first and last full drives, which went 77 and 92 yards, almost exclusively on the ground.  “They took it that first possession and pretty much drove it at ease, and then the last possession as well,” Ferentz said. “They’ve got a good football team as you know, and I thought our defense played extremely hard.”  LSU won without starting quarterback Zach Mettenberger, out with a knee injury, and freshman Anthony Jennings didn’t have to do too much in his first start. He finished 7 of 19 for 82 yards with the one interception, smartly handing off to Hill for much of the team’s offense on the day.  LSU established its running game from the opening play, when Hill broke loose for a 42-yard gain, setting up an eight-play, 77-yard touchdown drive on all running plays. Jennings got the final 2 yards for a 7-0 lead.  Hill added a 14-yard touchdown in the second quarter for a 14-0 lead. At halftime, Iowa’s offense had mustered 73 total yards and three first downs.  Iowa’s defense kept LSU in check, however, and came up with a big play in the third quarter when Jennings’ pass sailed high and safety John Lowdermilk returned the interception 71 yards to the 1-yard line. He initially had a touchdown before an official review showed he lost the ball before entering the end zone. On third-and-goal, running back Mark Weisman scored from two yards to cut the lead to 14-7.  “To me it was a good defensive game overall,” Ferentz said. “Both teams were playing tough defense, and sometimes that’s what happens when good teams get together.”  Iowa was playing in the Outback Bowl for the fourth time in 11 seasons, having split with Florida in 2004 and 2006 and beaten South Carolina in 2009. LSU made its Outback debut, having lost three of its four previous bowl games, including the national championship game after the 2011 season.  NOTES: LSU junior DT Ego Ferguson, thought to be a potential high-round NFL Draft pick if he leaves early, did not travel with the team because of an undisclosed medical condition. ... LB James Morris had two sacks to lead the Iowa defense, with eight tackles in the first three quarters. ... Lowdermilk is the son of former Ohio State and Vikings center Kirk Lowdermilk. ... Hill’s 217 yards were the third-most in LSU bowl history and the third-most in Outback Bowl history." }

So there’s an urgent need for governments to find ways to stop people starting and to help smokers give up,” said Harpal Kumar, CRUK’s chief executive.  He said the study, which examined 63 research papers on the causes and consequences of tobacco use in many different countries, showed tobacco taxes are “a hugely powerful lever”.  They are also potentially a triple win, Kumar said, cutting the number of people who smoke and die from their addiction, reducing the health care burden and costs linked to smoking and at the same time increasing government income.

Emergency workers stand outside an apartment building which was destroyed by an explosion and a fire in Minneapolis January 1, 2014. REUTERS/David Bailey  The blast and blaze started at about 8 a.m. CST (1400 GMT) and engulfed the three-story building, which has a grocery store on its ground floor, they said.  Firefighters were forced to withdraw from the building minutes after arriving because of the severity of the fire and concerns about the building’s structural integrity and it was not possible to determine if everyone was accounted for, the fire department said in a statement.  Huge flames shot from windows and clouds of billowing smoke enveloped the building as firefighters battled the early New Year’s Day blaze in sub-zero temperatures.  “When crews initially arrived on scene, they reported flames shooting as far as 20 feet out of the windows of the second and third floors,” Minneapolis Fire Chief John Fruetel told reporters at the scene.  Firefighters climbed an aerial ladder with hoses to douse the fire, and the water quickly formed icicles and a shell of ice encased the building.  The injured were rushed to two local hospitals, six of them in critical condition, fire and police officials said. Thirteen were transported immediately and another person approached emergency responders later in the morning.  The injuries included burns and traumatic injuries consistent with a fall, said Robert Ball, spokesman for Hennepin County Emergency Medical Services.  First responders told emergency dispatchers that people had jumped from the building and some injured people were on the street as they arrived.  Fruetel said the cause of the fire was under investigation.  “It will certainly take us some time to determine the cause and origin of the fire,” Fruetel said.  The building is located in an ethnic community of predominantly Somali immigrants, near the campus of the University of Minnesota.  “This is a tragic event,” said Abdi Warsame, a newly elected City Council member who represents the neighborhood. “My heart goes out to the victims and their families." }

French and African troops deployed in the country have struggled to stop the tit-for-tat violence between Muslim Seleka rebels, who seized power in March, and Christian self-defense militia, clashes that killed more than 1,000 people in December.  Residents of Bangui said that Seleka forces wearing civilian clothes threw grenades at Christian houses in a northern district of the city, setting them alight. Christian youths then launched reprisal attacks, burning nearby Muslim homes.  “The Muslims came and set fire to the houses ... everyone was affected,” said Aristide Yenga, resident of the Ngou Simon neighborhood in the north of the capital Bangui.  “This morning they began shooting and when we heard that we left for the larger (displaced persons’) camps.”  The body of a Seleka fighter with his left hand severed off and missing lay in the middle of a large dirt avenue following the attacks, a Reuters witness said. A resident of the neighborhood who asked not to be named said that two other Muslims had been killed there overnight.  No peacekeepers were present, although a French helicopter flew overhead, the Reuters witness said.  The incidents occurred in the city’s fifth district which houses both Muslims and Christians and near where heavy artillery battles took place the previous two nights.

It was not clear if those killed were the Muslims from the northern district. The previous day a four-month-old baby died from a gunshot wound, the charity said in an earlier statement.

With the temperature teetering at 13 degrees and continuous snowfall hampering conditions on the ice, the Original Six rivals had difficulty moving the puck and maintaining any offensive consistency. Mother Nature briefly let up and the teams traded goals in both the second and third periods before Bozak ended the wild affair by snapping a low shot past United States Olympic goaltender Jimmy Howard and inside the left post.  James van Riemsdyk, who joined teammate Phil Kessel on the U.S. roster, scored while playing in his third Winter Classic and Jonathan Bernier made 41 saves for the Maple Leafs, who have won three in a row and improved 4-0-2 in their last six games. Captain Dion Phaneuf notched a pair of assists, one day after signing a seven-year, $49 million contract extension.  Daniel Alfredsson scored in his return from back spasms and former Michigan State star Justin Abdelkader backhanded home a centering feed to forge a tie with 5:32 remaining in the third period.

Third-year North Texas coach Dan McCarney rebuilt a program that last played in a bowl in 2004. The Mean Green (9-4) won at least nine games for only the fifth time in school history after going 4-8 last season.  “We sent a message today,” McCarney said after the game held in the Cotton Bowl. “I think this is a program that’s clearly on the rise. We have some tremendous guys coming back. We’re going to miss these seniors, but the example these seniors have left is here forever.”  North Texas senior quarterback Derrick Thompson closed out his career by throwing for 256 yards and two touchdowns, including the go-ahead score in the third quarter. Wide receiver Brelan Chancellor scored two rushing touchdowns.  “We’re a second-half football team,” said Thompson, the game’s MVP. “We’ve been that all year. We knew if we picked up the tempo that we could do some things and move the football. We just made plays. It wasn’t anything special that we did. We just executed. The defense did the rest.”  The Mean Green defense was able to contain UNLV (7-6) after the Rebels scored on their first drive of the game. UNLV managed just 262 yards of offense, well short of its regular-season average of 423.8 yards.  “We had a couple opportunities that we didn’t capitalize on,” UNLV coach Bobby Hauck said. “Really what happened to us in particular in the first half — to a degree in the second half, as well — we would get something going and then we’d take a negative play.”  Rebels quarterback Caleb Herring passed for 196 yards and two touchdowns but was virtually shut down for the majority of the game before throwing a meaningless fourth-quarter score. UNLV ran for only 66 yards for an average of 2.4 yards per carry.  “They covered us up a little bit, and they were getting some push and making Caleb move his feet,” Hauck said. “Again, they have pretty good players up front, and they did a nice job.”  The Mean Green took their first lead at 14-7 by grinding out a 12-play, 60-yard drive in the third quarter. North Texas converted four third downs, including Thompson’s 7-yard touchdown pass to wide-open tight end Drew Miller.  North Texas added two more long scoring drives to put the game away. Chancellor had 3-yard touchdown on the opening play of the fourth quarter and Thompson connected with wide receiver Darnell Smith from 34 yards midway through the quarter.  The Rebels drove 95 yards on their first possession for a 7-0 lead. Herring completed all five of his throws during the march, ending with a 9-yarder to wide receiver Marcus Sullivan for the score.  The Mean Green tied the score late in the first quarter after recovering a fumbled punt return at the UNLV 42. Running back Antoinne Jimmerson powered in from the one-yard line eight plays later.  That proved to be all the scoring in the first half, as the teams went into the locker room tied 7-7. Both offenses struggled to move the ball despite near-perfect conditions.  North Texas defensive backs dropped two potential interceptions, the second being a likely pick-6 in the final minute of the second quarter. A blocked UNLV field goal attempt and touchdown return was also negated by a timeout from McCarney just before the kick.  NOTES: North Texas improved to 3-5 in bowl games and UNLV dropped to 3-1. ... UNLV had its first winning season since 2000. All six losses were to bowl-eligible teams. ... North Texas coach Dan McCarney led North Texas to its first bowl appearance since 2004 and first nine-win season since 2003. ... UNLV leads the all-time series with North Texas 4-1." }

The cost overruns on the $3.2 billion canal extension, one of the world’s largest construction contracts, should be met by the Panama Canal Authority (PCA) under the terms of the contract, argued the consortium comprised of Spain’s Sacyr, Italy’s Impregilo, Belgium’s Jan De Nul and Panama’s Constructora Urbana, SA.  The overruns were the result of unforeseen events during construction, something which was “normal” in these kind of projects, it said.  The group believes the PCA has “failed in its obligations as set out in the contract as well as in the inexactitude of the information provided to the consortium to carry out the project.”  Under the terms agreed, the PCA has another 21 days to comply with the requirements, it added, during which work will continue.  No one at Sacyr was immediately available for further comment.

REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/Files  LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - James Avery, a classically trained actor best known for his role as the wealthy uncle of the young rapper Will Smith in the 1990s television comedy “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” has died at age 65.  Avery’s death was confirmed to CNN by his publicist, and more widely in a Twitter message on Wednesday by one of the actor’s TV co-stars, Alfonso Ribeiro, who played his son, Carlton, on “Fresh Prince.”  “I’m deeply saddened to say that James Avery has passed away. He was a second father to me. I will miss him greatly,” Ribeiro said in a tweet.  According to the celebrity website TMZ, Avery died on Tuesday, New Year’s Eve, from complications he suffered after recent open-heart surgery.  Avery’s voice was heard in many animated TV series, including “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Iron Man,” and he guest-starred on “That ‘70s Show” as a police officer.  But the Atlantic City, New Jersey native gained fame on television playing family patriarch Uncle Philip Banks on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” which starred Will Smith as a young rap artist from a tough Philadelphia neighborhood who ends up living with well-heeled relatives in the affluent Bel-Air section of Los Angeles.  The sitcom, which ran on NBC for six years, was built largely around the clash of cultures between the refined lifestyle of Banks and his household and the brash, freewheeling attitudes of his nephew.  The show, a launching pad for Smith’s own acting career, ended with a series finale in which Uncle Philip puts his mansion up for sale and it is bought by George and Louise Jefferson - actors Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford - of “The Jeffersons.”  More recently, Avery had a recurring role as a deputy medical examiner on the cable drama series “The Closer.” His last screen credit, according to the Internet Movie Database website was the 2013 TV comedy movie “Go, Bolivia, Go!”" }

A woman fills out her thoughts on the Affordable Care Act at the White House Youth Summit on the Affordable Care Act in Washington December 4, 2013. REUTERS/Kevin Lamarque  More than 2 million people enrolled in private plans offered under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, during the initial sign-up period for health benefits. Enrollment began in October and lasts through March, but Americans in most states had to enroll by last week to get coverage that takes effect with the start of the new year.  A spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said there were no hiccups to report in the first day the plans were in effect.  The expansion of coverage through the new plans is one of the main parts of the 2010 law, the most sweeping U.S. social legislation in 50 years. Over time, the law - which requires most Americans to buy insurance, offers subsidies to help low-income people get covered and sets minimum standards for coverage - aims to dramatically reduce the number of Americans who lack health insurance, which the U.S. government has estimated at more than 45 million.  After a difficult October launch plagued by problems with the website used to enroll people in coverage, the focus for the government and healthcare providers has turned to what will happen beginning on Wednesday when patients with the new coverage start to seek care.  The law still faces political and legal hurdles. Roman Catholic Church-affiliated organizations obtained last-minute court injunctions on Tuesday that gave them temporary exemptions from a part of the healthcare law that requires employers to provide insurance policies covering contraception.  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted one temporary injunction to Baltimore-based Little Sisters of the Poor and Illinois-based Christian Brothers Services, plus related entities.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had 10,000 agents on call for New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day to field questions from people dealing with enrollment problems.  “We are ready ourselves to assist consumers as well with our full complement of call center representatives available,” said Julie Bataille, spokeswoman for the CMS.  At the start, confirming a patient’s plan may present headaches for care providers. The Obama administration has acknowledged that errors occurred in transmitting enrollment data to insurers, especially early in the enrollment period. An official said it was “reaching out” to providers who have expressed concerns about implementation, and was also trying to help anticipate problems.  “It will be difficult for us to actually verify coverage - that’s my concern,” said Dr. William Wulf, chief executive of Central Ohio Primary Care, which has 250 primary-care physicians.  The task could be made more difficult by decisions by the U.S. government and many states to push back enrollment deadlines toward the end of the year. The late deadlines mean that many enrollees who seek care initially may lack insurance cards or other proof of coverage.  Wulf said his physician offices will assume existing patients are covered if they say they are when they come in for appointments and their coverage cannot be verified immediately. But if they require expensive tests, such as MRIs or heart-stress tests that can cost up to $700, the practice will check with insurers first to make sure the patient has coverage.  Dr. Andy Chiou, chief executive of Peoria Surgical Group Ltd in Illinois, said that if the practice finds a “significant minority” of its patients do not have coverage when they believe they do, it might delay elective surgeries for patients until their insurance is confirmed.  “For the protection of patients and us, we’ll have to say, ‘Sorry, you don’t have insurance,’” Chiou said.  POLITICAL STAKES HIGH  For the Obama administration, the political stakes are high in ensuring a smooth transition period for coverage, particularly after the website’s problems damaged the popularity of the Democratic president and the healthcare overhaul, his signature domestic achievement.  The White House trumpeted New Year’s Day as the start of healthcare coverage for millions of Americans.  “The challenges in our healthcare system were decades in the making and won’t be solved overnight, but now more than 6 million Americans have been enrolled in marketplace or Medicaid coverage and are getting peace of mind,” wrote White House health policy adviser Phil Schiliro in a blog post.  Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, have called Obamacare a costly program that will rob many Americans of insurance choices and have said they will make Obamacare’s problems their top issue in the November 2014 elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.  Late Wednesday, though, Democrats in the House seized on the first day of the expansion as a political victory and pushed Republicans to give up on defanging the law.  “When Congress reconvenes next week, it is my hope that Republicans will work with Democrats to implement this law rather than continuing their focus on repealing its important patient protections and cost-saving reforms,” said Steny Hoyer, who is the second most powerful Democrat in the House as Minority Whip, in a statement.  Still, Republicans were bolstered by Sotomayor’s injunction, with Senator Roy Blunt, vice chairman of the Senate Republican Conference, saying the insurance mandate is “an egregious and blatant violation” of religious freedom.  The U.S. government has tried to anticipate the coverage problems new enrollees might encounter. The federally run Healthcare.Gov website posted advice last week on what enrollees should do if they have not received an insurance card, encounter problems getting coverage for a drug prescription, or need to appeal a decision by an insurer.  “For consumers whose marketplace coverage begins on January 1, we’re doing everything we can to help ensure a smooth transition period,” Kathleen Sebelius, the U.S. secretary of health and human services, said in blog posting on Tuesday.  “What we are stressing to folks is that if they get to a provider (and) there is some confusion (about coverage), call their insurer,” Schiliro said. “If the insurer is not able to resolve it, they should call our toll-free number (800-318-2596) ... and operators will be there 24/7.”  Some healthcare companies are trying to get ahead of potential problems as well.  The pharmacy chain Walgreen Co said on Monday it would allow consumers who had not yet received plan identification numbers from their insurers to get prescriptions at no upfront cost in January, if they could provide evidence of their coverage or pharmacy staff could otherwise confirm it.  Wal-Mart said on Tuesday it would institute a similar practice.  HOSPITALS READY FOR CHANGE  Hospital executives said they were ready for potential hiccups with the newly insured.  The vast majority of Americans have employer-based coverage and Medicare plans and can choose new plans every January, so executives said the beginning of the Obamacare plans represented a more intense version of an insurance transition period they were already familiar with.  “Hospitals feel like they’re pretty well prepared because they’ve had systems in place and tools in place to work through these sorts of issues,” said Jeff Goldman, vice president of coverage policy for the American Hospital Association. “We expect an uptick in volume, but we don’t think it’s anything beyond what most hospitals are prepared to handle.”  As many as 7 million people were expected to sign up for coverage in the Obamacare plans for 2014, but enrollment is so far well short of that figure, largely because of the problems with the HealthCare.gov website. Residents of 36 states use the site to enroll. Those in the other 14 states use state-run websites. Hospitals, therefore, may have been preparing for more new enrollees than they are likely to see at this point.  At New York’s Montefiore Medical Center, staffers were trained on how the new healthcare plans work, partly so they could help patients resolve any coverage issues, said Lynn Richmond, the medical center’s chief of staff.  “There’s not a lot of active worry on our part,” Richmond said. “We feel ready to manage the hiccups.”  Indeed, many have eagerly anticipated the law’s broadening of coverage. Across the country, hospital operators’ finances have been weighed down by patients who have been unable to pay their bills because they lacked sufficient insurance.  “We’re looking forward to the first quarter and beyond because we feel we’re in a very good position to benefit from the ACA,” said Steven Campanini, a spokesman for Tenet Healthcare Corp, one of the largest publicly traded hospital chains." }

More than 2 million people enrolled in private plans offered under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, during the initial sign-up period for health benefits. Enrollment began in October and lasts through March, but Americans in most states had to enroll by last week to get coverage that takes effect with the start of the new year.  A spokeswoman for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, or CMS, part of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, said there were no hiccups to report in the first day the plans were in effect.  The expansion of coverage through the new plans is one of the main parts of the 2010 law, the most sweeping U.S. social legislation in 50 years. Over time, the law - which requires most Americans to buy insurance, offers subsidies to help low-income people get covered and sets minimum standards for coverage - aims to dramatically reduce the number of Americans who lack health insurance, which the U.S. government has estimated at more than 45 million.  After a difficult October launch plagued by problems with the website used to enroll people in coverage, the focus for the government and healthcare providers has turned to what will happen beginning on Wednesday when patients with the new coverage start to seek care.  The law still faces political and legal hurdles. Roman Catholic Church-affiliated organizations obtained last-minute court injunctions on Tuesday that gave them temporary exemptions from a part of the healthcare law that requires employers to provide insurance policies covering contraception.  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted one temporary injunction to Baltimore-based Little Sisters of the Poor and Illinois-based Christian Brothers Services, plus related entities.  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services had 10,000 agents on call for New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day to field questions from people dealing with enrollment problems.  “We are ready ourselves to assist consumers as well with our full complement of call center representatives available,” said Julie Bataille, spokeswoman for the CMS.  At the start, confirming a patient’s plan may present headaches for care providers. The Obama administration has acknowledged that errors occurred in transmitting enrollment data to insurers, especially early in the enrollment period. An official said it was “reaching out” to providers who have expressed concerns about implementation, and was also trying to help anticipate problems.  “It will be difficult for us to actually verify coverage - that’s my concern,” said Dr. William Wulf, chief executive of Central Ohio Primary Care, which has 250 primary-care physicians.  The task could be made more difficult by decisions by the U.S. government and many states to push back enrollment deadlines toward the end of the year. The late deadlines mean that many enrollees who seek care initially may lack insurance cards or other proof of coverage.  Wulf said his physician offices will assume existing patients are covered if they say they are when they come in for appointments and their coverage cannot be verified immediately. But if they require expensive tests, such as MRIs or heart-stress tests that can cost up to $700, the practice will check with insurers first to make sure the patient has coverage.  Dr. Andy Chiou, chief executive of Peoria Surgical Group Ltd in Illinois, said that if the practice finds a “significant minority” of its patients do not have coverage when they believe they do, it might delay elective surgeries for patients until their insurance is confirmed.  “For the protection of patients and us, we’ll have to say, ‘Sorry, you don’t have insurance,’” Chiou said.  POLITICAL STAKES HIGH  For the Obama administration, the political stakes are high in ensuring a smooth transition period for coverage, particularly after the website’s problems damaged the popularity of the Democratic president and the healthcare overhaul, his signature domestic achievement.  The White House trumpeted New Year’s Day as the start of healthcare coverage for millions of Americans.  “The challenges in our healthcare system were decades in the making and won’t be solved overnight, but now more than 6 million Americans have been enrolled in marketplace or Medicaid coverage and are getting peace of mind,” wrote White House health policy adviser Phil Schiliro in a blog post.  Republicans, who control the House of Representatives, have called Obamacare a costly program that will rob many Americans of insurance choices and have said they will make Obamacare’s problems their top issue in the November 2014 elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.  Late Wednesday, though, Democrats in the House seized on the first day of the expansion as a political victory and pushed Republicans to give up on defanging the law.  “When Congress reconvenes next week, it is my hope that Republicans will work with Democrats to implement this law rather than continuing their focus on repealing its important patient protections and cost-saving reforms,” said Steny Hoyer, who is the second most powerful Democrat in the House as Minority Whip, in a statement.

Avery’s death was confirmed to CNN by his publicist, and more widely in a Twitter message on Wednesday by one of the actor’s TV co-stars, Alfonso Ribeiro, who played his son, Carlton, on “Fresh Prince.”  “I’m deeply saddened to say that James Avery has passed away. He was a second father to me. I will miss him greatly,” Ribeiro said in a tweet.  According to the celebrity website TMZ, Avery died on Tuesday, New Year’s Eve, from complications he suffered after recent open-heart surgery.  Avery’s voice was heard in many animated TV series, including “Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles” and “Iron Man,” and he guest-starred on “That ‘70s Show” as a police officer.  But the Atlantic City, New Jersey native gained fame on television playing family patriarch Uncle Philip Banks on “The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air,” which starred Will Smith as a young rap artist from a tough Philadelphia neighborhood who ends up living with well-heeled relatives in the affluent Bel-Air section of Los Angeles.  The sitcom, which ran on NBC for six years, was built largely around the clash of cultures between the refined lifestyle of Banks and his household and the brash, freewheeling attitudes of his nephew.  The show, a launching pad for Smith’s own acting career, ended with a series finale in which Uncle Philip puts his mansion up for sale and it is bought by George and Louise Jefferson - actors Sherman Hemsley and Isabel Sanford - of “The Jeffersons.”  More recently, Avery had a recurring role as a deputy medical examiner on the cable drama series “The Closer.” His last screen credit, according to the Internet Movie Database website was the 2013 TV comedy movie “Go, Bolivia, Go!” (Reporting by Steve Gorman; Editing by Barbara Goldberg and Steve Orlofsky)" }

Gunmen gesture during fighting in Ramadi January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Stringer  The attacks on three police stations in Falluja, Ramadi and Tarmiya represent a serious escalation in the confrontation between Iraqi Sunni groups and the Shi’ite-led government of Prime Minister Nuri al-Maliki.  Sunni anger at the government’s crushing of a protest movement has inflamed Iraq’s already deeply rooted sectarian tensions. The camp dismantled on Monday has been seen as an irritant to Maliki since it was set up to protest against perceived Sunni marginalization a year ago.  “Gunmen in large numbers surrounded the three police stations in Falluja and forced all policemen to leave without their weapons if they wanted to spare their lives. All of us left, we didn’t want to die for nothing,” a policeman stationed at one of the three stations told Reuters.  The gunmen then took control of a local government building nearby, deploying snipers on its roof to prevent the security forces from retaking command of the police stations in Falluja, 50 kilometers west of Baghdad.  Clashes between gunmen and security officials in Ramadi, another city in Anbar, continued for a third day on Wednesday, and also involved assaults on police stations by militants driving vehicles mounted with machine guns.  In a separate attack, at least four policemen were killed and 12 more wounded when gunmen attacked a police headquarters in the mainly Sunni town of Tarmiya, north of Baghdad, police reported.  Dozens of trucks loaded with gunmen were roaming the streets in Falluja and Anbar, and three police vehicles were set ablaze near one police station in Ramadi, a police source said.  The prime minister has offered some concessions to Sunni protesters, including proposed reforms to tough anti-terrorism laws, but most Sunni leaders say they will not be enough to appease the demonstrators.  The Shi’ite premier may also seek to consolidate his position before 2014 parliamentary elections by taking a tough stance against hardline Sunni Islamists.  More than 8,000 people have been killed in such violence this year.  Wednesday’s attacks began only hours after a decision by Anbar’s governor to lift a curfew imposed on Monday after fighting had erupted in various parts of the province.  Maliki had said the civilian police force could resume control over Anbar’s security, but that decision was changed after an appeal by the province’s governor.  “The governor of Anbar Ahmed Khalaf appealed to the Prime Minister to keep the army in Anbar because al Qaeda fighters managed to enter on Wednesday and controlled some parts of the province,” the governor’s office told Reuters.  Violence in Iraq has hit its highest levels since the sectarian fighting of 2006-7, which killed tens of thousands of people." }

Armstrong threw a 99-yard touchdown pass to Enunwa in the third quarter to give Nebraska (9-4) a 24-12 lead. Enunwa split the middle of a cover-2 defense by the Bulldogs, eluded safety Quincy Mauger and completed the longest scoring play in Nebraska and Gator Bowl history.  It was Enunwa’s 12th touchdown reception of the season, breaking one of Nebraska’s oldest records, set by Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Rodgers in 1971.  “It was one of those situations where there wasn’t much we could do,” Enunwa said. “I’m lucky our coaches trust us as playmakers. I got into the hole (in Georgia’s coverage) and made the best play I could.”  Nebraska coach Bo Pelini said, “Coach (Tim) Beck (Nebraska’s offensive coordinator) decided to take the shot and we liked the call and the opportunity. (Georgia) put a lot of guys up there.”  Georgia (8-5) cut the lead to five points on a 25-yard scoring pass from quarterback Hutson Mason to running back Todd Gurley but got no closer after coming up empty on its final two possessions.  The Bulldogs reached the Nebraska 22-yard line with a 48-yard pass from Mason to Michael Bennett but lost the ball on downs when Cornhuskers safety Andrew Green jarred a pass loose from Georgia’s Rantavious Wooten.  Georgia forced a punt and got to the Nebraska 23. But the Bulldogs stalled again and tight end Arthur Lynch dropped a pass on fourth-and-3 from the Nebraska 16 with 31 seconds left that would have been good for a first down.  The Bulldogs could have had chip-shot field-goal attempts, but coach Mark Richt played for the win both times.  “We really didn’t think about kicking the field goal,” he said. “We knew if we made it (a first down) we could score a touchdown and take the lead. We knew we were in four-down territory.  “We had a good back, and it was wise to give him the ball. Since we were in four-down territory, it freed us up to run the ball a little bit.”  Armstrong completed only 6-of-14 passes, but two of those were the touchdowns to Enunwa, who caught four passes for 129 yards.  Big Ten rushing leader Ameer Abdullah gained 122 yards on 27 carries for Nebraska.  Mason, who was making his second career start in place of injured Aaron Murray, completed 21-of-39 passes for 320 yards and connected with Gurley seven times for 97 yards. Gurley added 86 yards rushing on 21 carries.  “I felt great the whole game,” Mason said. “The first couple of drives we got some big third downs (conversions) and I didn’t feel like I came out slow. It wasn’t perfect, but we weren’t finishing like we could have.”  He also refused to blame the sloppy field.  “It was not great field conditions, but we weren’t really slipping out there a ton,” Mason said. “I didn’t see anyone coming out of the break slipping. It was not an excuse for any player.”  A rare Gator Bowl game played in the rain resulted in a sloppy first half for both teams. The first period was scoreless and the second second was dominated by special-teams plays.  Georgia kicker Marshall Morgan put the first points on the board with a 38-yard field goal, but it was a bitter consolation prize after Mason was chased out of the pocket on a third-and-2 from the Nebraska 10 and was then called for intentional grounding.  The Bulldogs forced the Cornhuskers to punt on the next possession, but returner Reggie Davis fumbled after calling for a fair catch and Nebraska’s Josh Mitchell recovered at the Georgia 14.  After a 9-yard gain by Abdullah, Armstrong Jr. lobbed a 5-yard touchdown pass to Enunwa to give the Cornhuskers a 7-3 lead.  Georgia came up with a special-teams play of its own as J.J. Green returned the kickoff 48 yards to the Bulldogs’ 48. After Mason completed a 37-yard pass to Brendon Douglas to the Nebraska 15, the drive stalled when Mason misfired on two passes and Morgan came in to kick a 28-yard field goal.  The teams then swapped field goals on the final two possessions of the half. Nebraska kicker Pat Smith booted a season-best 46-yard field goal and Morgan drilled a 38-yarder as time expired to cut the Cornhuskers’ lead to 10-9.  NOTES: Nebraska WR Quincy Enunwa’s 99-yard touchdown catch from QB Tommy Armstrong broke two records that were set in 1965 — the Gator Bowl mark for longest touchdown pass by Oklahoma’s Ronnie Fletcher to Ben Hart in a 36-19 loss to Florida State and the Nebraska record for longest pass play, which was a 95-yard pass from Fred Duda to Freeman White on Oct. 23, 1965, against Colorado. For good measure, Enunwa and Armstrong combined for the longest scoring play in Gator Bowl history, topping Greg Allen’s 95-yard kickoff return for Florida State in a 31-12 victory over West Virginia in 1982. ... Georgia K Marshall Morgan’s four field goals gave him seven in a row at EverBank Field and eight of nine in three games in Jacksonville. He was 3 of 3 against Florida on Nov. 2 against Florida and made 1 of 2 in 2012 against the Gators. ... The steady rain that began 30 minutes before kickoff marked the first time since the 1996 Gator Bowl between Syracuse and Clemson that it had rained during the game." }

Now the company wants to spend $16 million to convert the terminal to ship coal.  Bans on iron ore mining and exports in India’s top producing states of Karnataka and Goa have choked the industry so hard that MMTC is one of many firms exiting. Even if efforts to fully lift the bans make it past the many bureaucratic and legal hurdles, iron ore miners do not expect complete resumption of production until late 2014.  The bans, put in place as the government tried to clamp down on illegal mining, have cut India’s iron ore exports by around 85 percent, or 100 million tonnes, over the past two years. They have also reduced foreign exchange earnings by more than $17 billion in the same period, according to the Federation of Indian Mineral Industries (FIMI).  The structural shift in India’s iron ore industry could be a blessing for other suppliers, as demand growth from top market China slows and Australian miners Rio Tinto and BHP Billiton ramp up output. It will also make it harder for India to regain its spot as the world’s No.3 exporter of the steelmaking raw material.  “It’s pretty evident that there’s lasting damage to the industry,” said R. K. Bansal, a secretary general at FIMI. “But if the government of the day at the state and central level, as well as other authorities, stick their neck out and take decisions then this paralysis can go.”  Mining in Goa was banned in September 2012, freezing shipments that reached about 50 million tonnes in the 2010-11 fiscal year. In neighbouring Karnataka, where the ban started in 2011, exports remain frozen even though it was lifted in April. In both states, the bulk of mining was done by private companies, which were accused of mining outside lease areas and in excess of set limits.  MMTC was banking on business from Karnataka when it invested along with Indian partners Sical Logistics Ltd and L&T Infrastructure Development Projects in an iron ore terminal in Ennore Port in the southern Tamil Nadu state.  “We think that at least in the next five to six years there will be no exports of iron ore,” said SM Babu, general manager at MMTC’s Chennai office. Instead the joint venture company hopes to tap growing demand for coal-fired power plants in Tamil Nadu.  Only 16 out of 115 mines have resumed mining in Karnataka. For those keen on returning, the bureaucratic hurdles can be overwhelming.  “There are about 30 or 40 companies whose quantities are so low that they will never restart,” said Basant Poddar, owner of Mineral Enterprises Ltd, which has four mining leases in Karnataka but none operating currently.  “For those willing, the issue is with forest clearances. The whole process goes through about 50 levels or officers for stage one clearance, and for stage two it’s cut down to about 20.”  On Monday, Vedanta Resources Plc, a London-based mining conglomerate controlled by Indian tycoon Anil Agarwal, said its Sesa Sterlite unit had resumed operations in Karnataka after clearance from a court-appointed panel.  CHINA APPETITE WANING  Jiro Iokibe, analyst at Daiwa Securities in Tokyo, sees Indian iron ore exports of 15 million tonnes next year, rising to 20 million tonnes in 2015. This is well below the record of more than 117 million tonnes in 2009-2010.  Lower Indian supply has eased pressure on a market seen moving to surplus given expansion by low-cost producers such as Rio Tinto, BHP Billiton and Brazil’s Vale while growth in Chinese demand eases.  India’s exports to China reached just over 10 million tonnes in January-November, down 68 percent from a year earlier.  “Definitely people are not depending now on Indian material,” said a trader in Shanghai who is among a few left selling only Indian iron ore to Chinese mills. “Most traders have switched to mainstream cargoes from Australia and Brazil and cargoes from India are going at a discount of maybe up to $4 a tonne.”  India’s central and state governments, which put in place the various bans under direction from a Supreme Court determined to clamp down on illegal mining, appear keen on getting the iron ore sector back on its feet.  “We have placed all the regulatory measures we have undertaken in front of the Supreme Court so that we can resume mining operations,” Prasanna Acharya, mines director in Goa, said in November.  The court has set up a panel that will determine a limit on Goa’s production. The panel is expected to submit an interim report by Feb. 15, but Acharya has said he does not expect a resumption in mining before October at the earliest.  COLLATERAL DAMAGE  When the iron ore miners give up, so do businesses relying on the raw material.  Out of the 53 sponge iron making plants in Karnataka with annual production capacity of about 3 million tonnes, 19 have closed and 27 are operating at half their capacity due to a shortage of iron ore, said Deependra Kashiva, executive director of the Sponge Iron Manufacturers Association.  India is the world’s top producer of sponge iron, an alternative steelmaking ingredient that is economically viable where natural gas is abundant and cheap.  At Sesa Sterlite’s 7 million-tonnnes-per-year mine in Codli Village, about 50 kilometres east of Goa’s capital Panaji, machinery operator Lakshdeep Asrekar is among a few who still report to work.  Asrekar is lucky because many have lost their jobs, with industry group FIMI estimating job cuts at 200,000 across Goa and Karnataka.  “We come and start our machinery and dumpers and keep them running for 15-20 minutes so that they are in working condition,” said Asrekar.

REUTERS/Site Intelligence Group/Handout  Prosecutors said Colleen LaRose, 50, should be sentenced to “decades behind bars” for her role in a failed 2009 plot to kill Lars Vilks, a Swedish artist who offended many Muslims by drawing the Prophet Mohammed on the head of a dog.  After years of delay, the American-born LaRose is expected to be sentenced on Monday in Philadelphia. A similar hearing for Mohammad Hassan Khalid, the youngest person ever charged with terrorism in the United States, is set for Tuesday.  U.S. guidelines call for LaRose to receive a life sentence and for Khalid, who is now 20, to receive 15 years. Given their cooperation, prosecutors asked the judge to sentence LaRose to “decades behind bars” and Khalid to “less than 10 years.”  In a presentence filing this week, U.S. authorities reiterated what they declared when LaRose’s arrest was made public in 2010 - that her gender, blond hair, Texas twang and green eyes make her case significant because she does not fit the stereotype of an Islamic terrorist.  “News of LaRose’s arrest spread shockwaves throughout the West, as people recognized that the face of the terrorism threat had changed forever,” prosecutors Jennifer Arbittier Williams and Matthew Blue wrote. “The world is watching, and this sentencing presents an important opportunity to send a strong message to other lonely, vulnerable people who might be enticed by online extremists promising fame and honor.”  A 2012 Reuters investigative report (reut.rs/1eqk6sJ)  described LaRose’s troubled life before she converted to Islam: childhood rapes by her biological father, teenage prostitution, heavy drug abuse and failed marriages. LaRose said that her father’s sexual assaults, confirmed by confidential court records, began in second grade.  “I survived a lot of things that should have rightfully have killed me,” LaRose said in an exclusive interview from jail in 2012.  LaRose’s story has helped prosecutors and FBI agents better understand the roots of homegrown extremism, U.S. officials said.  LaRose was living with a oft-travelling boyfriend in 2007 when a romantic encounter with a Muslim man sparked an interest in Islam. After months of learning online, LaRose said, she converted to Islam and later watched videos of alleged U.S. and Israeli atrocities against Palestinian children that radicalized her.  By 2008, prosecutors said, “she had managed to align herself with violent terrorists who valued her ability and persistence as their online predator, or ‘hunter,’” recruiting new fighters.  “I just loved my brothers so much, when they would tell me stuff, I would listen to them, no matter what,” LaRose told Reuters. “And I also was ... lost.”  In 2009, LaRose followed instructions from an al Qaeda operative in Pakistan and flew to Europe for the plot to kill the Swedish artist. But after six weeks, largely in Ireland, LaRose became frustrated with the mission’s pace and returned to Philadelphia, where she was arrested.  Ali Damache, her alleged handler in Ireland, remains jailed there, fighting extradition to the United States on terrorism charges. Jamie Paulin Ramirez, who flew from Colorado to marry Damache in Ireland, pleaded guilty to related terrorism charges. She may be sentenced on Wednesday.  Prosecutors said Khalid, who grew up in Pakistan, lived a double-life after moving to Maryland - as “a polite and studious 15-year-old” and “a tireless soldier for violent jihad.” He helped al Qaeda by translating videos from Urdu to English, inciting others, and aided LaRose as she smuggled a stolen U.S. passport to a terrorist, they said.  After pleading guilty, LaRose and Khalid each met more than 20 times with U.S. authorities, providing information about multiple targets. In particular, authorities cited Khalid’s insight into al Qaeda’s propaganda and recruitment efforts.  LaRose’s lawyer, Mark Wilson, could not be reached on Wednesday. Khalid’s lawyer, Jeffrey Lindy, declined to comment. But documents in the case show the lawyers will cite deep mitigating psychological issues as they argue for shorter sentences.  For his part, the intended victim said in 2012 that LaRose has served enough time. “They should let her go,” Vilks said." }

Arsenal's Theo Walcott (2nd R) shoots and scores past Cardiff City goalkeeper David Marshall (R) during their English Premier League soccer match at the Emirates Stadium in London January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Dylan Martinez  The conclusion of the congested festive schedule saw a tired display by the Londoners who looked set to draw a blank for the second straight home game before Bendtner bundled home in the 88th minute and Walcott wrapped up the points in stoppage time.  Manchester United’s difficulties returned as the champions were beaten 2-1 by Tottenham Hotspur at Old Trafford, their sixth league defeat and fourth at home in a stuttering season.  Their rivals Manchester City briefly went top after subduing a battling Swansea City 3-2 away while Chelsea beat Southampton 3-0 on the road and Liverpool won 2-0 at home to Hull City.  Arsenal, with 45 points from 20 games, stayed one point clear of Manchester City and two ahead of Chelsea in third with Liverpool a further four points off the pace.  Everton’s Leighton Baines converted an added time penalty to rescue a 1-1 draw at Stoke City as the Merseysiders dropped to fifth, while 10-man Newcastle United stumbled to a 1-0 defeat at West Bromwich Albion.  Spurs, who took a 2-0 lead with goals from Emmanuel Adebayor and Christian Eriksen before Danny Welbeck pulled one back for United, moved above their opponents into sixth. David Moyes’s United team are now 11 points adrift of the leaders.  ARSENAL FORTRESS  After Arsenal’s last home game ended in a goalless draw against Chelsea, the fans were fearing another shutout at The Emirates that would have shunted them off top spot.  Cardiff City, playing in front of former Manchester United forward Ole Gunnar Solskjaer, who sat alongside owner Vincent Tan and is expected to become their new manager, defended stoutly before the home side’s pressure told late on.  “I think we were mature, intelligent and resilient,” Arsenal boss Arsene Wenger said. “We want to make this place a fortress and take the points no matter what the others do.”  The result kept Manchester City at bay after they showed their title credentials with a fifth consecutive league win.  City came out on top thanks to second-half strikes from Yaya Toure and Aleksandar Kolarov after Swansea’s Wilfried Bony had canceled out Fernandinho’s early opener.  Bony grabbed a stoppage-time consolation for Swansea who are now without a win in six league games.  Chelsea’s misfiring forwards had failed to find the target away from Stamford Bridge during the whole of 2013, but the hoodoo was broken on the hour at St Mary’s when Spaniard Fernando Torres headed home from close range.  Willian smashed home a second from the edge of the area and fellow substitute Oscar, who had a hand in all three goals, added the third with a clinical finish after being sent racing through on goal.  SUAREZ STUNNER  If Chelsea’s strikers have been struggling, Liverpool have one who cannot stop finding the back of the net.  Luis Suarez made the game safe against Hull with a stunning free kick into the top corner for his 15th goal in seven home games this season. It was the seventh successive match at Anfield that the 20-goal Uruguay striker had found the net.  A Daniel Agger header had put Liverpool on their way to victory after back-to-back away defeats by Manchester City and Chelsea over the Christmas period.  “It was arguably our best win of the season, on the back of what was a tough schedule for us with a light squad,” Liverpool manager Brendan Rodgers said. “The energy, as you’d expect, was not what it has been but we showed great resilience today.”  Manchester United came into their clash with Tottenham having won six games in a row in all competitions, but any optimism generated by that revival drained away as their home form again let them down.  Togo striker Adebayor, whose Tottenham career has been revitalized since Tim Sherwood took over from sacked manager Andre Villas-Boas in mid-December, opened the scoring when he headed home a deep floated cross after 34 minutes.  The visitors drew United’s sting and were well on top when Eriksen got in front of his marker to head in a deflected cross from Aaron Lennon after 66 minutes before a defensive lapse allowed Welbeck to chip goalkeeper Hugo Lloris a minute later.  Stoke’s Liverpool loanee Oussama Assaidi scored the opening goal against his parent club’s local rivals Everton but Baines coolly equalized from the spot.  West Ham went ahead after seven minutes against relegation rivals Fulham but Steve Sidwell leveled in the 32nd and 12 minutes later visiting captain Kevin Nolan was sent off for kicking out at Fernando Amorebieta.  Slideshow (7 Images)  Fulham’s Bulgarian striker Dimitar Berbatov poked home midway through the second half to make it 2-1.  Gabriel Agbonlahor got the only goal as Villa won 1-0 at Sunderland while Newcastle had Mathieu Debuchy sent off against West Brom, who recorded their first league win in 10 games thanks to Saido Berahino’s late penalty.  Norwich City also had a man sent off at fellow strugglers Crystal Palace with Leroy Fer dismissed late on for a second booking. Palace’s Jason Puncheon equalized with a penalty after Bradley Johnson had curled in the opener for the Canaries." }

Jamal al-Jamal, 56, died in hospital after the incident at his home on the morning of New Year’s Day.  “According to information from the investigation so far, this was definitely not a terrorist attack,” national police president Martin Cervicek said on Czech Television.  Police spokeswoman Andrea Zoulova said an explosive - which may have been part of a security mechanism - went off after the safe was opened. “With the greatest probability, an explosive device placed on the door of the safe was triggered,” she said.  The Palestinian foreign ministry, in a statement reported by the official WAFA news agency, said the blast happened minutes after Jamal opened a safe that had come from the embassy’s old offices.  The mission is in the course of moving into new premises next to the residence in a suburb of the capital.  Zoulova told reporters: “The possibilities include inexpert handling of an explosive device or its spontaneous detonation ... The device was in a safe and was triggered after the door of the safe was opened.”  Some safes can be fitted with small charges to destroy secret documents in the event of the lock being tampered with.

Jamal suffered lethal injuries to his head, chest and abdomen, surgeon Daniel Langer told Czech television.  No one else was injured in the explosion, police said, although a spokeswoman for Prague’s emergency medical services said a 52-year-old woman was treated for smoke inhalation and shock. Jamal’s family was at home at the time of the blast.  No sign of damage to the two-storey house was visible outside, but police cordoned off part of the street while bomb experts searched the premises.

Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad al-Malki, quoted by WAFA, said Jamal was “martyred in the line of duty”.  Born in Beirut to a refugee family, Jamal joined Yasser Arafat’s Fatah faction of the Palestine Liberation Organisation in 1975 and served in PLO missions to Bulgaria and Czechoslovakia in the 1980s.

Danny Leclair (C) and Aubrey Loots (R) become the first same sex couple to marry in the 125th Rose Parade in a service performed on the AIDS Healthcare Foundation float in Pasadena, California January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn  The nuptials of Danny Leclair, 45, and Aubrey Loots, 42, who have been together for 12 years and own a local chain of hair salons, marked the first same-sex marriage on a Rose Parade float in the 125-year history of the annual event, organizers said.  In the past, two heterosexual couples have tied the knot during Rose Parades - in 1989 and last year.  Leclair and Loots made it official aboard a float shaped like a wedding cake coated in white coconut chips, accented with red kidney beans and festooned with 12,000 roses and other floral decorations, said Ged Kenslea, a spokesman for the AIDS Healthcare Foundation.  The foundation sponsored the float to celebrate same-sex marriage and the role it can play in helping to reduce new HIV infections among gay men, he said.  The minister who performed the wedding, Alfreda Lanoix, an openly lesbian reverend for the Unity Fellowship Church of Christ, tossed handfuls of rose petals into the air to mark the completion of the ceremony.  The parade was witnessed by an estimated 700,000 spectators who lined the 5 1/2 mile procession route and by millions of viewers tuning into one of several networks carrying the event live in the United States and broadcasting it around the world. The parade also was live-streamed over the Internet.  WEDDING FLOAT TAKES THE CAKE  The wedding float ended up winning the tournament’s Isabella Coleman Award for “best presentation of color and color harmony through floral use.”  In the parade procession, the wedding float was in a lineup that included a high school marching band from Reno, Nevada, a float sponsored by the city of Beverly Hills, and another float sponsored by the Lutheran Laymen’s League featuring a banner that said: “Jesus Welcomes All.”  Joining the newlyweds on the float was a married lesbian couple, Sharon Raphael and Mina Meyer, who have been together 42 years, Kenslea said.  Loots, who is originally from South Africa, and Leclair, a native of Canada, met at a Los Angeles nightclub and originally had planned for a relatively low-key wedding until the opportunity to exchange vows in the Rose Parade surfaced.  “For me, I was moved by the stand that the AIDS Healthcare Foundation was taking,” Leclair told Reuters on Monday.  Loots said he had been traveling when he got a message from his partner asking if he would want to get married on a Rose Parade float.  “I said, ‘You’re crazy! Of course, let’s celebrate our love in front of the world,’” he recounted, adding that the couple were also motivated by the chance to offer hope to same-sex couples who in most states are still denied marriage rights.  “Being on top of this cake floating down the road is truly for the men and women in the world that don’t have these opportunities,” he said.  Wednesday’s event comes at a time of increasing momentum for the cause of gay marriage in the courts, at the ballot box and in statehouses across the United States.  Slideshow (8 Images)  As of this month, same-sex matrimony has been legally recognized in 18 states and the District of Columbia, with the tally more than doubling during the past year, due in most cases to litigation over the issue.  The trend has gained steam since the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in June 2013 that married same-sex couples are eligible for federal benefits, striking down a key part of the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act.  In a separate decision the same day, the high court let stand a lower-court ruling that overturned California’s voter approved ban on gay marriage as unconstitutional." }

Gunshots were heard near the presidential palace on Wednesday evening. A presidential spokesman said security forces most likely fired the shots at residents breaking a curfew.  Both sides are under mounting pressure from regional and Western powers to reach a deal to stop the bloodletting that has killed more than 1,000 people in the world’s newest state and displaced nearly 200,000 more.

Militias and tribesmen have seized ports and oilfields across Libya to press for political or financial demands, cutting output to around 220,000 bpd from 1.4 million bpd in July. Oil is the main source for the budget and for the funding of food imports.  Western powers fear the North African country will slide into instability as the government struggles to rein in militias that helped topple Muammar Gaddafi in 2011 but kept their arms.  “There’s a huge impact of this (strike) issue. Salaries for Libyans are now at risk,” Labour Minister Mohamed Swalin told a news conference.  The strikes would lead Libya into a “dark tunnel” and deter the return of foreign companies that left during the 2011 uprising.  Oil pipelines and production facilities as well as exploration efforts would be also affected should the blockages continue, he said.  The government has put pressure on tribal leaders in East Libya to persuade an armed autonomy group to lift the blockage of the Ras Lanuf, Es-Sider and Zueitina ports, previously accounting for 600,000 bpd.  But autonomy leader Ibrahim Jathran said at the last minute that talks with Tripoli to gain a greater share of oil revenue for the east had failed.  There has also been no progress toward reopening Hariga port in the far east, despite an announcement by a local oil official last week that the terminal would resume exports within days.  In another conflict, members of the petroleum protection force threatening to block a gas pipeline from eastern Libya to Tripoli said they would give the government another day to meet their salary demands.  The protesters had said on Sunday they would halt gas flows by Tuesday but a spokesman for them told Reuters they had agreed to extend the deadline until Thursday as tribal leaders wanted to meet them.  A blockage would worsen power supplies, the state power company said in a statement. Outages have hit Tripoli and other major cities for weeks.  Prime Minister Ali Zeidan has said the government will act against the oil strikes but its nascent army, still in training, it too weak to tackle heavily armed protesters, analysts say.

Down on Mexico’s Pacific coast, a drug gang was already making it a reality.  Port security patrol the delta of the River Balsas in the port of Lazaro Cardenas November 20, 2013. REUTERS/Edgard Garrido  The Knights Templar cartel, steadily diversifying into other businesses, became so successful at exporting iron ore to China that the Mexican Navy in November had to move in and take over the port in Lazaro Cardenas, a city that has become one of the gang’s main cash generators.  This steelmaking center, drug smuggling hot spot and home of a rapidly growing container port in the western state of Michoacan occupies a strategic position on the Pacific coast, making it a natural gateway for burgeoning trade with China.  Lazaro Cardenas opened to container traffic just a decade ago, and with a harbor deep enough to berth the world’s largest ships, it already aims to compete with Los Angeles to handle Asian goods bound for the U.S. market.  But that future is in doubt unless the government can restore order and win its struggle with the Knights Templar, who took their name from a medieval military order that protected Christian pilgrims during the Crusades.  Mexico’s biggest producer of iron ore, Michoacan state is a magnet for Chinese traders feeding demand for steel in their homeland. But the mines also created an opportunity for criminal gangs, such as the Knights Templar, looking to broaden their revenue base into more legitimate businesses.  “The mines were mercilessly exploited, and the ore was leaving. But not in rafts or launches - it was going via the port, through customs, on ships,” said Michoachan’s governor, Fausto Vallejo, soon after the Navy occupied the port on November 4.  Already a thriving criminal enterprise adept at corrupting local officials and squeezing payments from businesses, developers and farmers, the Knights took to mining with aplomb, according to entrepreneurs and miners working around the port.  Hidden behind mountain roads about an hour from Lazaro Cardenas, one small town mustered hundreds of trucks this year to lead the gang’s scramble to the port, a local miner said.  That town - Arteaga - is the birthplace of Servando Gomez, the former school teacher who leads the Knights Templar.  Gomez understood the potential of Lazaro Cardenas, which was a village best known for its coconuts until the government decided to build a steelworks there 40 years ago.  The gang’s trucks sped around Michoacan’s iron mines to supply Chinese buyers, helping to push ore exports to 4 million tons by October from 1-1.5 million tons a year previously.  Their business rests on several pillars, according to accounts of local officials, miners and entrepreneurs.  Firstly, the Knights controlled how the ore moved, having imposed protection charges on local transport unions after becoming the dominant gang in the city a few years ago.  It also helped local prospectors stake claims to mine areas either unclaimed by others or beyond the control of the existing concession-holders. Then the Knights took their cut.  Finally, the gang pressured customs officials to ensure the ore passed through the port smoothly.  “Most of the groups mining are Knights Templar or belong to them. They have the whole chain,” a local official told Reuters.  Fueled by the appetite of Chinese buyers, about half the mining in the area was done without proper permits this year, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Those who talk openly can pay dearly. In April, an official at steel maker ArcelorMittal who local businessmen said had reported illegal mining to authorities was shot dead.  One prospector from Arteaga, who asked to remain anonymous, said he ran a mine selling unprocessed iron ore to Chinese traders for $32 per ton, giving him a profit of about $5-7 per ton. By the time it reached China, the buyers could expect to sell the ore for a profit of around $15 per ton, he estimated.  Because the Knights Templar control much of the local iron supply, the gang has pressured Chinese buyers to purchase ore from them or face reprisals, said a Mexican government security official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The combination of organized crime and Chinese buying of Mexican iron ore poses a problem for President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has gone out of his way to cultivate ties with China.  China’s President Xi Jinping has been in office only since March, but Pena Nieto has already met him three times. In June, Pena Nieto welcomed Xi to Mexico, signing a string of economic cooperation deals. But at the top of the agenda was how to narrow the massive trade imbalance between the two nations.  Bilateral trade was worth $62.7 billion in 2012, up from just $431 million two decades ago, Mexican data shows. But 90 percent is accounted for by Chinese exports to Mexico, most of it goods such as computers and component parts.  CHAOS, LOCKDOWN, MORE CHAOS  Much of that trade goes directly through Lazaro Cardenas.  In 2012, it had the biggest rise in traffic in North America’s 20 top container ports, handling 1.2 million 20-foot equivalent units, or teus.  Most of the port is still a dusty plain above which birds of prey soar in stifling heat. In a few years, though, projects started by Maersk-unit APM Terminals and Hutchison Port Holdings could expand its capacity to about 8 million teus - the amount moved in 2012 by the continent’s top container hub, Los Angeles.  But Michoacan is not California.  Seven years ago, then-President Felipe Calderon began a nationwide crackdown on organized crime in Michoacan, sending in the army to tackle increasingly violent drug cartels.  Over 80,000 people have since died in gang-related killings across Mexico, and assurances Pena Nieto gave that he would stop the rot when he took power a year ago are wearing thin.  Although parts of Mexico have become safer since Pena Nieto took office, Michoacan has fallen into even more chaos.  Over half of the state lives in poverty. Traditional work like resin production is dying out due to competition from China and elsewhere. That creates new recruits for organized crime.  In October, a local bishop likened Michoacan to a failed state. A few days later, assailants temporarily knocked out power for hundreds of thousands in the state with a string of attacks on installations of the national electricity utility.  Many blamed the Knights, though signs posted in Michoacan accused a small rival gang of staging the attack.  The Navy took over the port authority and reinforced Lazaro Cardenas shortly afterward. All the local police and customs officials were initially suspended and the caravans of trucks carting ore started to thin out.  But the lull is unlikely to last unless the government can regain control of the city beyond the port gates and open up mining to legitimate prospectors not controlled by the gang.  Miners complain that the main concession-holders such as ArcelorMittal, which did not respond to requests for comment, use only a fraction of their land and are reluctant to let others mine it. The Knights have turned that dispute into money.  Days after the Navy moved in, state governor Vallejo said criminal enterprise around Lazaro Cardenas could be worth up to $2 billion a year - or about half Michoacan’s 2012 budget.  ‘EVERYONE IS PAYING’  Some involved in the mining industry say the area has become safer since the Knights Templar started to take control.  But the facts suggest otherwise: government figures show kidnappings in Michoacan reached a record level in 2013, and murders climbed to a 15-year peak.  Gomez has appeared in several YouTube videos trying to portray his Knights Templar as defenders of Michoacan.  In one posted in August, he said the Knights had provided paid protection at the request of avocado farmers but that they did not extort businesses. However, he also conceded that some “foolish” members of his gang probably had engaged in extortion.  The Knights’ power in Lazaro Cardenas is often subtle.  Unlike parts of northern Mexico living under the threat of violence, the restaurants, taco stands and bars on the city’s main palm-lined boulevard are alive with people as night falls.  Some residents say they are not squeezed by the cartel, and big companies say they can operate without fear of extortion.  “We don’t pay a cent to anyone,” said Jose Zozaya, head of Kansas City Southern Mexico, which operates the rail link that connects the port with the United States.  But others quickly vent their anger about the Knights.  “Everyone is paying, but they won’t tell you,” said a local entrepreneur. “The people here are destroyed.”  The port is no stranger to crime, and during Calderon’s presidency it became a big entry point for chemicals from China and other parts of Asia used to make methamphetamine. Some locals say chemicals have even been used to pay gangs for the iron ore.  Asked if Mexico had discussed the iron ore issue with Beijing, a senior government official said: “The Chinese government doesn’t always know what the companies are doing. The occupation of the port ... was the control measure adopted.”  Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, said she was unaware of the situation in Lazaro Cardenas, adding: “But I can tell you that the Chinese government has consistently educated and asked Chinese companies to respect the law in other countries when they carry out business and trade cooperation.”  Successful Chinese firms are growing quickly in the region.  Since setting up in 2009, Desarrollo Minero Unificado de Mexico (DMU), a Chinese iron mining company in Lazaro Cardenas, has gone from three employees to 600 nationwide, nearly all of them Mexicans, Director General Luis Lu told Reuters.  Slideshow (7 Images)  With more than 30 concessions, Lu said his company mined all of its own iron and had not had any trouble with organized crime. He said he could not say how other Chinese firms fared.  Still, Chinese success in Michoacan has caused friction with the Knights Templar. In the August YouTube video, gang leader Gomez had some strong words for them.  “We have an excessive invasion of Chinese. An excess of Chinese,” he said, surrounded by armed men. “It may suit the interests of various corporations, I don’t know. But they’re here with us now. And these people have their mafias too.”" }

Josip Perkovic was one of 10 people arrested, state news agency Hina reported, as an amended law took effect that brought the country’s extradition laws into line with most of the rest of the bloc.  He is sought in connection with the 1983 murder of a Yugoslav dissident in Bavaria, allegedly orchestrated by communist Yugoslavia’s secret services for which he then worked.  He has denied wrongdoing. His lawyer, Anto Nobilo, told state television HRT that Perkovic would oppose extradition, saying he did not expect a fair trial in Germany and because he had already been investigated and cleared of all charges in Croatia.  Shortly before joining the EU on July 1, Zagreb changed its laws to prevent the extradition of suspects in crimes committed before 2002, when new EU extradition rules had taken effect.  The government said it wanted to protect veterans of Croatia’s 1991-95 independence war from facing potential prosecution elsewhere in the EU, and denied any connection to the Perkovic case. Some EU member states have the same 2002 time limit.  But the government removed the time restriction in August after the European Commission warned it could face legal action, including the possible loss of EU funds.  The amended law took effect on January 1 and Hina said that in addition to Perkovic, police had immediately arrested a second Yugoslav era intelligence chief, Zdravko Mustac, and eight others.  “It is now a matter for the police and the judiciary. The new law is applied equally to everyone,” President Ivo Josipovic said.  Perkovic had worked for the communist-era secret service, the UDBA, and led the intelligence service in Croatia after the breakup of Yugoslavia.  His lawyer Nobilo said a local court should rule on whether Perkovic would be extradited within eight days.  Perkovic, who could not be reached for comment, said last month he was ready to testify before a Croatian court as soon as the new law took effect." }

India froze payments for the 12 AW101 helicopters after Finmeccanica’s then chief executive was arrested in February for allegedly paying bribes to secure the deal, embarrassing the New Delhi government before parliamentary elections due by May 2014.  The scrapping of the deal, which will now go through a probably lengthy legal process, would be a fresh setback for Finmeccanica. Delays in selling some of its money-losing assets have prompted credit rating agencies to downgrade the company to junk.  But it would offer an opportunity for rivals such as United Technologies Corp’s Sikorsky Aircraft, EADS unit Eurocopter and Lockheed Martin to get a share of India’s burgeoning defence market.  India’s defence minister, A.K. Anthony, has said he did not believe AgustaWestland’s denial that it paid bribes to swing the deal. Anthony had a meeting with Indian Prime Minister Manmohan Singh hours before the latest decisions were announced.  “The Government of India has terminated with immediate effect the agreement that was signed with M/S. AugustaWestland International Ltd (AWIL) on 08 February, 2010 for the supply of 12 VVIP/VIP helicopters on grounds of breach of the Pre-contract Integrity Pact and the agreement by AWIL,” the Defence Ministry said in a statement on Wednesday.  Finmeccanica spokesman Roberto Alatri, commenting on India’s decision, said the company would defend its position. It invoked the arbitration, which would be conducted in India under the Indian Arbitration and Conciliation Act of 1996.  “We’ll do everything that would be necessary to defend the correctness of our position,” Alatri told Reuters. “We’re sure our behaviour was ethically correct.”  He said India’s agreement to arbitration was a positive step.  India’s Defence Ministry said it believed “integrity-related issues are not subject to arbitration” but nominated an arbitrator, it said, to safeguard its interests.  Uday Bhaskar, a defence analyst at the Society for Policy Studies in New Delhi, said India’s participation in the arbitration did not represent a climb-down.  “Cancelling deals and saying that we will not acquire critically-needed equipment, to my mind, is not the answer,” Bhaskar said.  “But there’s no climb-down on this arbitration and as a matter of fact it might be the most viable via media (middle road).”  India in October had issued a final “show cause” notice to AgustaWestland seeking to terminate the contract. Sources told Reuters in November the deal would be scrapped.  ALLEGATIONS  Indian defence deals have been hit by a number of corruption allegations over the past two decades but a Defence Ministry spokesman said this was the first cancellation of a major deal.  Paying or accepting bribes is prohibited by India’s defence procurement rules. The government can cancel a contract if an integrity pact in the rules is violated, and the seller has to forfeit any security money it deposited as a bidder.  India’s federal auditor said in August the ministry had initially stipulated that the helicopters should be able to fly to an altitude of 6,000 metres (19,685 feet), which meant that AgustaWestland could not compete since the AW101 was certified to fly only to 4,572 metres (15,000 feet).  India took delivery of three of the helicopters before the deal stalled but the Defence Ministry spokesman said the fate of those aircraft was “uncertain”." }

Silica is powdered quartz, in particles so small they can be inhaled deep into the lungs. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) estimates that 2.2 million people in the U.S. are exposed to silica at work, including 1.85 million construction workers.  Other occupations carrying a risk of silica exposure include sandblasting, mining, stone grinding, as well as ceramic and glass manufacturing. Dental assistants may be exposed if they grind silica-containing casts and porcelains.  Silica has long been known to cause silicosis, and evidence now confirms that silica exposure can cause lung cancer as well, Kyle Steenland of Emory University in Atlanta, a co-author of the new report, told Reuters Health.  Silicosis causes varying degrees of breathing difficulty, and there is no cure or treatment. Recent research has also shown that non-smokers can get lung cancer from silica exposure, and that people who develop silica-related lung cancer don’t always have silicosis, Steenland and his colleague Elizabeth Ward of the American Cancer Society note.  OSHA is planning to lower permissible levels of silica exposure from 0.1 milligrams per cubic meter of air to 0.05 mg/m3, which the agency estimates will save 700 lives per year, and prevent 1,700 cases of silicosis annually. The current standard dates back to 1971.  The preferred approach to reducing silicon exposure is to use less hazardous materials, ventilate work areas where silicon dust is produced and use water-based methods so dust can’t escape into the air, Steenland said.  “Respirators may be useful for workers in short-term high exposure situations, but are generally not recommended as the primary means of exposure control due to worker discomfort, difficulties in communicating with others, lack of compliance and enforcement, and the fitting and maintenance requirements,” Steenland and Ward write in their report, published in CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians  Anyone who has been exposed to silica and smokes should quit, Steenland said in an interview. Smoking aggravates the carcinogenic effects of silica, and smokers with high silica exposure can cut their risk of lung cancer up to five-fold by quitting, according to the new report.  People with a history of silica exposure may also qualify to undergo screening for lung cancer using CT scanning, the investigators note.  OSHA recently extended the public comment period for the proposed silica exposure rule to January 27, 2014 (see:).  While there is always a balance between worker protection and employers’ interests, “I’m fairly confident that this standard will be put into place,” Steenland said.

A man looks over the Affordable Care Act (commonly known as Obamacare) signup page on the HealthCare.gov website in New York in this October 2, 2013 photo illustration. REUTERS/Mike Segar  U.S. Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor granted one temporary injunction to Baltimore-based Little Sisters of the Poor and Illinois-based Christian Brothers Services, plus related entities.  Two different appeals courts granted stays in three other cases that had been pending at the high court, filed by various organizations, including Catholic University of America and non-profits in Michigan and Tennessee, according to a lawyer representing the groups. The lower court action meant the Supreme Court did not need to act in those cases.  The groups were all asking the courts to exempt them temporarily from the so-called contraception mandate while litigation continues. The mandate, which was due to take effect for the organizations on Wednesday, is already in place for many women who have private health insurance.  The organizations accuse the federal government of forcing them to support contraception and sterilization in violation of their religious beliefs or face steep fines.  The 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, requires employers to provide health insurance policies that cover preventive services for women, including contraception and sterilization.  The act makes an exception for religious institutions such as houses of worship that mainly serve and employ members of their own faith, but not schools, hospitals and charitable organizations that employ people of all faiths.  As a compromise, the administration agreed to an accommodation for non-profits affiliated with religious entities that was finalized in July.  Under the accommodation, eligible non-profits have to provide a “self certification” - described by one lower court judge as a “permission slip” - that authorizes the insurance companies to provide the coverage. The challengers say that step alone is enough to violate their religious rights.  In separate cases, the Supreme Court already has agreed to hear oral arguments on whether for-profit corporations have the basis to object to the contraception mandate on religious grounds. The court is due to hear the arguments in March and decide the two consolidated cases by the end of June." }

Manchester City's Fernandinho (L) celebrates scoring a goal against Swansea City with Matija Nastasic during their English Premier League soccer match at the Liberty Stadium in Swansea, Wales, January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Rebecca Naden  Second-half strikes from Yaya Toure and Aleksandar Kolarov after Swansea’s Wilfried Bony had cancelled out Fernandinho’s early opener helped City record their fifth consecutive Premier League win.  Bony grabbed a stoppage-time consolation and his second of the match with a skidding drive into the bottom corner, but there was to be no dramatic rescue for Swansea who are now without a win in six Premier League games.  City moved to the top of the table with 44 points from 20 games, two clear of Arsenal who can retake the lead with victory at home to Cardiff City later on Wednesday.  Manchester City, who have now recorded back-to-back away league wins for the first time this season, have taken 25 points from their last 27 and scored 57 goals in the opening 20 games to lay down a marker in the congested tussle at the top of the table.  “The character of the team in the second half to go and score another goal (after Swansea equalized) was very important,” City manager Manuel Pellegrini told the BBC.  “You must not only play good football, you must have the character to try to recover when these things happen...  “It is satisfying because in the Premier League the last four games we play away, we have won three and drawn one, we must continue in the same way.”  ACHILLES HEEL  Swansea’s home form has been their Achilles heel this season, having recorded only two wins at the Liberty Stadium, and coming into the game memories were still fresh of their 3-0 defeat in the reverse fixture last month.  Injuries to key players Michu, Michel Vorm and Nathan Dyer did not help their cause against the league’s most impressive array of talent.  City started brightly and made their superiority tell in the 14th minute when Fernandinho, left unmarked on the edge of the area from a corner, drilled home with a raking low drive.  They took their foot off the gas, however, as the rain lashed down in south Wales, allowing Swansea to claw a foothold in the game and equalize in first-half stoppage time.  Bony, who looked to be in an offside position, got between Vincent Kompany and Pablo Zabaleta to head home an Angel Rangel cross.  At that point it looked as if City’s suspect away form, having already lost four times on the road, may come back to haunt them, but nerves were steadied with a typically emphatic strike from midfield powerhouse Toure.  He picked up the ball on the edge of the box and spun away from two defenders before firing low into the bottom corner, a moment of quality that framed the difference between the two sides.  Slideshow (3 Images)  City’s third had an element of good fortune about it as Kolarov’s powerful strike from the edge of the area, after a lung-busting burst forward down the left flank, found the net due to poor keeping from Gerhard Tremmel.  Bony, by far Swansea’s most threatening player on the day, smacked home a skidding drive that seemed to pick up pace of the slippery turf, but there was to be no dramatic finale.  “I think once again the performance was good, especially in the first half, but if you concede three goals to an opponent like Manchester City, it is very unlikely you will get anything from the match,” Swansea City manager Michael Laudrup said." }

Kenya’s first large-scale international mining project began production in October, after being delayed since 2006 due to financing constraints, environmentalist protests, compensation disputes with local farmers and government red tape.  Some 330,000 tonnes of ilmenite a year, about 10 percent of world supply, will be produced at the mine, located south of the Indian Ocean port city of Mombasa.  The mine will also churn out 80,000 tonnes of rutile per year, representing 14 percent of global output, and a further 30,000 tonnes of zircon. The minerals are used as pigment in paper, plastics, ceramics and titanium metal.  Joe Schwarz, Base Resources general manager for external affairs and development, said on Wednesday that the company was awaiting the outcome of an application for an export permit from Kenya’s mining ministry.  Base Resources previously said it expected exports to start in December.  Schwarz said the first shipment would comprise rutile, a mineral used in the manufacture of electronic appliances. It will go out as containerized cargo from Mombasa to Japan.  “We do have international customers already lined up apart from Japan, in far flung nations of the USA, Europe, China and the Middle East,” Schwarz said in a company statement.  He said another 25,000 metric tonnes of ilmenite would be also shipped in February, and that the company expected to send out about 15 bulk shipments each year.  Kenya, east Africa’s largest economy, is seeking to derive a bigger share of earnings from its relatively modest and undeveloped mining sector, and the launch of the flagship $305 million mining project is seen as integral to that plan.

REUTERS/Yuri Gripas/Files  Obama was not referring to his public negotiating team, led by senior State Department official Wendy Sherman, nor even to his secretary of state, John Kerry, who was soon to sweep in from Tel Aviv to join the early November discussions in Geneva.  Rather, White House chief of staff Denis McDonough recalled, Obama was talking about a secret group led by Bill Burns, Kerry’s discreet, disciplined and self-effacing deputy.  At times using U.S. military aircraft, hotel side entrances and service elevators to keep his role under wraps, Burns undertook arguably the most sensitive diplomatic mission of Obama’s presidency: secret talks with Iran to persuade it to curb its nuclear program.  In picking Burns, seen by his peers as a leading U.S. diplomat of his generation, Obama gave the envoy, who speaks Arabic, French and Russian, a chance to ease more than 30 years of estrangement between the United States and Iran.  If it ensures Tehran does not build a nuclear bomb, the Iran deal could stand as the capstone to Burns’ 31-year diplomatic career.  If it fails, it could bring Israel or the United States closer to a military strike on Iran and fuel criticism that Washington squandered its best opportunity for a peaceful solution by appeasing Iran rather than pressuring it further.  Current and former U.S. officials, including four former secretaries of state, describe Burns as well suited to dealing with the Iranians, with the sensitivity to see Tehran’s perspective and the tenacity not to compromise U.S. interests.  “He is steady, reliable, intelligent, disciplined and - in his understated way - persuasive,” said former U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger.  “I like to hear his judgments and can learn from them,” Kissinger told Reuters. “That’s not something I volunteer very often.”  He said he saw Burns’ deft touch in the discreet way the diplomat, then ambassador to Russia, reported private conversations between Kissinger and Russian President Vladimir Putin back to Washington.  “I wanted to make sure they were not in the cable traffic lest they leak,” Kissinger said. “He handled that with great skill.”  Even those who square off across the table speak well of Burns.  He “knows Iran very well and also understands Iran’s culture, expectations and position in the region,” said a senior Iranian official, speaking on condition of anonymity. “Sometimes during the talks Iranian negotiators get angry and pressure him, but he remains calm and patient.”  BUREAUCRATIC SKIRMISHES  Burns, 57, who has a lanky frame that he used to good effect on the basketball court in his youth, has executed the rarest of Washington careers. He has taken on politically perilous assignments such as heading the State Department’s Middle East shop during the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, all without a hint of personal failure or personal controversy.  Running the Bureau of Near Eastern Affairs, which handles Middle East policy, from 2001-2005 made him a participant in the epic struggles between the State and Defense Departments over the war and its aftermath - battles the Pentagon largely won.  Burns, who declined to be interviewed for this article, is no stranger to bureaucratic infighting, though colleagues sometimes conduct skirmishes on his behalf. “If an elbow has to be thrown, usually it’ll be thrown by someone else for him,” said one U.S. official.  In recent years, officials say, Burns has acted as liaison between the Obama White House, which directs foreign policy with a firm hand, and the State Department, where mid-level officials sometimes complain of being kept in the dark.  Over the past nine months, Burns, along with Jake Sullivan, Vice President Joe Biden’s national security adviser, met secretly with Iranian officials five times in Oman and Switzerland.  Their assignment became public only when Tehran and six major powers reached a November 24 agreement for Iran to constrain its nuclear program for six months in exchange for sanctions relief that Washington estimates at $7 billion.  Critics have targeted the deal rather than Burns. Some argue that the sanctions relief is worth more than the White House says, and will undercut U.S. economic leverage on Iran.  Former President George W. Bush was skeptical of talking directly about the nuclear issue with Iran. But in 2008, his final year in office, Bush sent Burns to meet with the Iranians, joining envoys from Britain, China, France, Germany and Russia.  “There was some skepticism in some quarters of the administration,” former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice told Reuters. “When I said to the president, ‘Well it’s going to be Bill Burns,’ he said: ‘He’ll be able to handle it.’”  Asked if Burns had any faults, Rice could only think of one: a demeanor so low-key that he sometimes does not generate headlines that could advance an administration’s agenda.  His style is in sharp contrast to that of another top diplomat of the era, the late Richard Holbrooke, known for his outspokenness and self-promotion.  “I sometimes think that if Bill were more demonstrative publicly, it could be helpful,” Rice said. “It takes a little pressure off the secretary. But Bill is just so understated that that doesn’t happen.”  ‘A CAPACIOUS MIND’  Burns’ understated style was evident as an honors student at Philadelphia’s LaSalle University, which his father, an Army general and former head of the U.S. Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, also attended.  “Bill would sit on the right side, near the back of the room, with his head looking down at the floor, his hands clasped between his knees, and I don’t think he ever took a note,” said George Stow, who teaches history at LaSalle. “I thought, oh this boy’s in trouble come the first exam.”  “Well, I opened the blue book for the first exam and it was astounding. It was page after page after page and filled with references and quotations from books and sources that I had never mentioned,” he added, saying Burns had “a capacious mind.”  Stow later sponsored Burns for a Marshall Scholarship, to study in Britain. The idea came from the professors, Stow said. “Bill would never, if I may use such a term, be that pushy.”  Despite the absence of obvious self-promotion, Burns has had an almost gilded career, spent more in Washington than abroad.  A string of staff jobs that are coveted, if exhausting, plums, put Burns at the right hand of officials such as Colin Powell, President Ronald Reagan’s national security adviser, and Warren Christopher and Madeleine Albright when they were secretaries of state.  Powell said Burns had a soft-spoken confidence as a young man and offered unvarnished advice behind closed doors.  “I don’t have people around me who pull their punches. I have people around me who will tell me when I have got no clothes on,” Powell told Reuters.  Richard Armitage, Powell’s deputy secretary of state, said Burns was part of a State Department leadership team that did not so much oppose the 2003 Iraq invasion, as favored a less unilateral approach to ousting dictator Saddam Hussein.  “Was he unhappy? Yes. We were all unhappy with the way we were going to war,” Armitage said, adding he, Powell and Burns favored obtaining a second U.N. Security Council resolution to explicitly authorize the use of force in Iraq.  While known for his courtesy, Burns is not shy about advocating for his preferred policies.  Jim Jeffrey, Bush’s deputy national security adviser, said Burns had swum against the tide in a skeptical Republican administration to make the case for engaging Tehran.  Slideshow (2 Images)  “He pushed very hard in 2008 to have contact with the Iranians,” making his case through then Secretary of State Rice and informally lobbying the national security council staff, Jeffrey said.  Those 2008 dealings with the Iranians helped pave the way to the November nuclear deal, Jeffrey said.  “This was one of the first steps that laid the ground work for what we have today, and laid the groundwork for the Iranian sympathy for and trust in Bill Burns.”" }

A Romanian Ion Ionut checks in his luggage for a flight to Heathrow airport in Britain, at Otopeni international airport near Bucharest January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Bogdan Cristel  From January 1, seven years after their countries joined the EU, Bulgarians and Romanians are free to live and work anywhere in the 28-nation bloc without applying for work permits.  The long-planned change has caused alarm in wealthier EU countries, where right-wing politicians and media are telling people to brace for a flood of southern Europeans who will take jobs from locals, strain public services and scrounge off the welfare state.  “Benefits Britain Here We Come! Fears as migrant flood begins,” said the tabloid Daily Express in a front-page headline on Wednesday.  With continent-wide elections to the European Parliament due in May, the scare about ‘benefit tourism’ provides ammunition for right-wing parties like France’s National Front, the Dutch Freedom Party and Britain’s UK Independence Party (UKIP).  Seeking to calm the debate, EU Employment Commissioner Laszlo Andor said there were already more than 3 million Bulgarians and Romanians living in other EU states, and ending all restrictions was unlikely to lead to any major increase.  “I firmly believe that restricting the free movement of European workers is not the answer to high unemployment or a solution to the crisis,” he said, referring to the EU’s lingering economic malaise in the wake of the 2008 global financial meltdown.  ‘NASTY COUNTRY’  The dropping of the curbs was the lead story in nearly all British media on Wednesday, with reporters heading to airports to interview a trickle of people arriving on flights from Bucharest or Sofia.  British Prime Minister David Cameron has rushed out regulations to stop migrants from the EU being able to claim welfare benefits straight away. Under pressure from UKIP, he has said he wants eventually to restrict migrants from poorer EU states relocating to richer ones.  Bulgarian President Rosen Plevneliev has attacked Cameron’s proposals, saying they will damage London’s global standing for the sake of short-term political gain.  EU Commissioner Andor said in November that Cameron’s suggestions risked “presenting the UK as a kind of nasty country in the European Union”, a comment that infuriated the prime minister.  In Wednesday’s statement, Andor acknowledged that a sudden large influx of people from other EU countries could strain education, housing and social services in particular regions.  But the solution was to “address these specific problems, not to put up barriers against these workers,” he said in a statement that did not single out any EU country for criticism.  Andor said that, in hard times, people who went to work in other EU countries were “all too often an easy target”, accused of taking jobs from local people or of abusing social welfare.  Slideshow (3 Images)  “In fact, studies have consistently shown the benefits of free movement of workers for the economies of host countries. Mobile workers complement host country workers by helping to address skills gaps and labor shortages.”  The European Commission estimates there are around 2 million unfilled job vacancies in the EU, he said.  Because a greater proportion of people who moved to other EU countries were of working age compared to host populations, they were more likely to be employed and were generally net contributors to the welfare system." }

He said Majid had been living in the city of Sidon.  The Abdullah Azzam Brigades’ Twitter account, from which they claimed the attack on the Iranian embassy, did not mention the arrest.  A civil war in neighboring Syria that pits majority Sunni Muslim rebels against President Bashar al-Assad, who belongs to a sect close to Shi’ism, has deepened sectarian resentment in Lebanon, whose own 15-year civil war ended in 1990.  Sunni hardline militant groups, including al Qaeda affiliates, have carried out attacks against the Lebanese Shi’ite Hezbollah group, an ally of Assad and of Shi’ite Iran.  The Abdullah Azzam Brigades have threatened more attacks in Lebanon unless Iran pulls its forces out of Syria, according to tweets at the time of the embassy bombing.  According to the Long War Journal, a respected counter-terrorism blog, Majid is among 85 individuals identified on a Saudi government list issued in 2009 as most wanted for their alleged involvement with al Qaeda.  The blog said that the Abdullah Azzam Brigades, named after a founder of al Qaeda and associate of the late Osama bin Laden, were formed sometime after 2005 as a spin-off of al Qaeda in Iraq.

Turkey's Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan addresses his supporters upon his arrival to Ataturk Airport in Istanbul December 27, 2013. REUTERS/Osman Orsal  “History will not forgive those who have become mixed up in this game,” Erdogan said in a televised end of year address devoted almost entirely to a corruption investigation he says has been engineered in police and judiciary to undermine his government and sap its influence in the Middle East and beyond.  Police raided offices and homes and detained businessmen close to the government and the sons of three ministers on December 17. Erdogan responded by purging some 70 officers connected with the inquiry and blocking a second investigation into big infrastructure projects promoted by Erdogan.  “I invite every one of our 76 million people to stand up for themselves, to defend democracy and to be as one against these ugly attacks on our country,” he said.  The scandal poses the biggest challenge to Erdogan in 11 years as leader, raising fears of a fracture in his AK Party in the run-up to elections and damage to strong economic growth.  It also pitches him against a U.S.-based Turkish cleric with strong influence in the police and judiciary, accused by Erdogan’s backers of conniving at the investigation. The former ally, Fethullah Gulen, denies the allegation.  “Whichever party you support, this plot targets all of you without exception, the bread on your table, the money in your pocket, the sweat of your brow,” he said.  Erdogan, who has won three elections, casts the scandal as a campaign by domestic dark forces and foreign financial organizations, media and governments resentful of a foreign policy more independent of NATO and the United States.  Foremost in his suspicions is Gulen, who has no political party but great influence in key state institutions based widely on his global network of private schools and media. Though their differences are not argued in public, the two have differed over foreign and domestic policies and the fate of the schools which Erdogan recently moved to close down.  “Circles uncomfortable with Turkey’s successes, its growing economy, its active foreign policy, its global-scale projects, implemented a new trap set against Turkey,” Erdogan said, sitting at a desk before the red Turkish national flag.  So great has been Erdogan’s dominance since his AK Party was first elected in 2002 on promises to banish corruption that his removal from power could prove traumatic for Turkey. He could yet call early elections to demonstrate his continued popularity and increase his power to handle the accusations.  Erdogan also said the investigation aimed to undermine “the picture of brotherhood” in a fragile peace process with Kurdish militants, launched in 2012 and aimed at ending a conflict which has killed 40,000 people.  “SAFE HANDS”  Erdogan said June anti-government protests across Turkey, triggered by a heavy-handed police crackdown on a demonstration against plans to redevelop Istanbul’s central Gezi Park, were part of the same conspiracy.  “Just as the Gezi incidents were dressed up in the cover of trees, parks and the environment, the December 17 plot was hidden in the cover of corruption.”  He said it was no coincidence that the attacks coincided with what he called one of the most successful years in modern Turkey’s 90-year history. The year has seen record highs in Turkish financial markets, credit rating upgrades and the paying off of the country’s IMF debt.  Erdogan’s supporters argue the graft accusations have so far lacked any substance.  President Abdullah Gul, seen as unifying figure who has largely stayed out of the furor, made an appeal for unity in his New Year’s message, emphasizing a need for an independent judiciary free of pressure from any side.

Vasiliki Kostoula, a Greek breast cancer patient, listens to her doctor after a radiological medical examination in an Athens hospital October 29, 2008. REUTERS/Yannis Behrakis  Mothers with young children were more likely to skip recommended radiation treatments after breast cancer surgery because of worries about the time involved, researchers found.  In particular, women who had a breast tumor removed were less likely to undergo radiation therapy afterwards if they had kids age seven or younger at home.  About 81 percent of women surveyed in the study who had younger kids received radiation therapy. The rates of radiation therapy for women with older kids or none at all ranged between 84 and 87 percent.  Put another way, one in five women with young kids in the study skipped potentially life-saving post-surgery treatment, said Ya-Chen Tina Shih, an economist and associate professor of medicine at the University of Chicago in Illinois who co-led the study.  “We were surprised because women in the younger age range have the longest life expectancy, so we expected to see a higher compliance rate among them,” she told Reuters Health.  “Women may think, ‘I really need to take care of the kids at home,’ and they may act on what they believe is most important at that time,” Shih said.  “But they may not be aware of how important radiation therapy is.”  Women who have “lumpectomy” surgery to remove a breast tumor - the researchers did not include patients who had mastectomies - are usually advised to follow up with radiation therapy, which requires a serious time commitment. The radiation treatments take up to an hour, five days a week, for up to seven weeks, the researchers report.  “Many have hypothesized that young children might be a barrier for younger women, but this paper is the first to demonstrate that,” wrote Dr. Nancy Keating in an email to Reuters Health.  Keating, an associate professor at Harvard Medical School’s Department of Health Care Policy in Boston, was not involved in the new study.  “It suggests there is a modifiable barrier to improving care: providing child care,” Keating said.  For their study, Shih and her team looked at 21,008 patients who filed breast cancer surgery claims between 2004 and 2009 with employer-sponsored insurance.  From the data provided by Truven Health Analytics, researchers knew how many kids - dependents - were in a woman’s household.  The team found additional barriers to radiation therapy. Patients who enrolled in HMO plans, or PPO plans with fixed reimbursement amounts, were less likely to follow through with the treatment. If a patient had to travel far for the surgery itself, then she was also less likely to get radiation.  But this study’s biggest contribution is highlighting how childcare may play a role, Keating said.  Women, like those in the study, who chose breast-conserving surgery and not a mastectomy, “may not understand that the surgery is equivalent to mastectomy in terms of outcomes if women also get the radiation,” Keating wrote.  Shih pointed out that one weakness in her team’s report, published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, was that they did not talk to the patients themselves to record their reasons for not getting radiation therapy.  The study shows an association between the age of a woman’s children and her likelihood of opting out of radiation, but does not prove cause and effect.  Future studies could also investigate the rates of radiation therapy among women without insurance, or with less generous benefits, Shih said.  But for now, “the person in charge of a patient’s entire cancer care needs to make sure that they know if a patient has younger kids,” Shih said.  “If friends and family can make a commitment to help with the patient’s child care needs for a month or two - that could make a big difference,” she said.  The findings “suggest that providers, like hospitals, physician groups or health systems, could potentially help by providing assistance with child care,” Keating said.

In New York, hordes of people, many decked out in cartoonish hats, waving balloons or ringing bells, shrugged off freezing temperatures and heightened security in Times Square for the annual New Year’s Eve street party.  Crowds heard musical performances by Miley Cyrus and Melissa Etheridge, who sang John Lennon’s “Imagine,” and then saw the ritual dropping of the New Year’s Eve ball.  U.S. Supreme Court Justice and New York native Sonia Sotomayor helped to usher in 2014 by pushing a button to signal the lowering of the 11,875-pound, crystal-encrusted ball and leading a 60-second countdown.  The stroke of midnight triggered a deluge of confetti and music in Midtown Manhattan.  “We’ve been living on granola bars and little bottles of water because if you move, you lose your spot,” said Sheila Harshbarger, who traveled to New York from Indiana with her daughter and staked out ground next to a row of police barricades in the freezing cold more than 14 hours before midnight.  Crew members on board the International Space Station orbiting the globe sent greetings to the Times Square crowd.  The celebrations were not without violence, however.  Several hours before the ball dropped in Times Square, two men were slashed at a nearby bus station in what a Port Authority spokesman said was a dispute over tickets.  Brasstown, in the mountains of North Carolina, held its 20th New Year’s Eve “possum drop” - in which a Plexiglas container containing a caged opossum is “dropped” at midnight.  FROZEN FESTIVITIES  “If New York can drop a ball ... then we can lower the opossum,” organizers explained on their website.  The event got a last-minute go-ahead after a judge refused a plea by animal-rights group People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals to stop the event.  Across the northern United States, partygoers had to deal with snow and freezing temperatures, said Roger Edwards, a meteorologist with the National Weather Service.  “The biggest story is the extreme cold,” Edwards said, predicting lows of 40 degrees below zero Fahrenheit (-40 degrees Celsius) on Tuesday night in North Dakota, Minnesota, and Wisconsin.  Fireworks explode past the Times Square Ball after it dropped to signal the start of the new year in Times Square, Midtown, New York January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Adrees Latif  Chicago was offering free rides on trains and buses from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. to ensure revelers make it home safely.  Residents in Vincennes, Indiana, didn’t let the cold stop their fifth annual Watermelon Drop and Fireworks - a nod to the area’s agricultural roots.  In Nashville, Tenn., revelers saw the “Music Note Drop” backed up by musical performances, including by Hank Williams Jr., and fireworks.  But not everyone partied in the streets. President Barack Obama celebrated the end of 2013 with a low-key foray to buy a cherry and lemon-lime “shave ice” in his native Hawaii before retreating to a vacation rental.  In San Francisco, one of the last major cities in the world to see the clock strike midnight, thousands saw waterfront fireworks illuminate the Golden Gate Bridge.  To the north, in a foggy Seattle, huge crowds gathered for a fireworks display launched from the Space Needle tower.  In Los Angeles, long notorious for lacking a centralized New Year’s Eve celebration befitting its association with glitz and glamour, organizers pulled together a free outdoor arts and music festival in and around downtown’s Grand Park.  SYDNEY, DUBAI, LONDON  Nineteen hours earlier, a massive fireworks display lit up the sky around the Harbor Bridge and Opera House in Sydney, Australia. In the Middle East, Dubai broke the Guinness World Record for the largest fireworks display, the website Emirates247 reported.  In London, edible banana confetti and strawberry mist rained from the sky as fireworks along the River Thames lit up Big Ben and other landmarks.  Across the United States, 2014 ushered in political changes and the official start of a slate of new laws.  New York City’s new mayor, Bill de Blasio, was sworn in at midnight in a private ceremony at his home in Brooklyn, succeeding Michael Bloomberg, who left office after 12 years. He was due to be formally inaugurated later at City Hall.  Americans who have signed up for new healthcare coverage under President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act were due to begin receiving benefits on January 1.  Before ushering in 2014, Sotomayor, the U.S. Supreme Court Justice, granted Roman Catholic-affiliated groups a temporary exemption from a part of the Obamacare healthcare law that requires employers to provide insurance policies covering contraception.  Also starting New Year’s Day, Colorado residents were legally permitted to buy an ounce of marijuana at a time from specially regulated retailers.  Slideshow (9 Images)  Possession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year.  “It will be like people waiting in line for tickets to a Pink Floyd concert,” said Justin Jones, 39, owner of Dank Colorado in Denver, who has run a medical marijuana shop for four years and now has a recreational pot license." }

The brief announcement did not explain the move or say how much new revenue it was expected to generate. The central bank is struggling to curb inflation, which is expected to end the year around 7 percent, and support the lira currency, which lost 17 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar last year.  The country’s banking watchdog has proposed curbing consumers’ use of credit cards to pay for goods such as cars with monthly installments, as a step to raise the domestic savings rate and reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign capital to finance consumption.  The consumption tax on passenger cars was raised by between 5 and 15 percentage points, depending on the size of engine, bringing it to a range of 45 to 145 percent.  The same tax was increased by 15 percent in lira terms on beer and 10 percent on other alcoholic beverages. The minimum tax on a packet of cigarettes was lifted to 3.75 lira ($1.75) from 3.22 lira, while the tax on mobile phones was raised to 120 lira from 100 lira, the official state publication said.

Roger Federer of Switzerland serves against Jarkko Nieminen of Finland during their men's singles match at the Brisbane International tennis tournament in Brisbane, January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Jason Reed  His debut appearance at the Brisbane International was rapturously greeted by tournament organizers and fans alike, but following his first year without a grand slam final appearance since 2002 it was not certain what stage of decline the Swiss ace was in.  A 6-4 6-2 victory over his tough Finnish opponent hinted that he was ready to put on a competitive showing at Melbourne Park, now relieved of the back problems that dogged his 2013 campaign and contributed to his second and fourth-round exits at Wimbledon and the U.S. Open.  “I’m actually very clear in my mind,” Federer told reporters. “Now it’s just down to forehands and backhands and tactics and movement. That’s kind of what you want it to be, because unfortunately it hasn’t always been that way last year with my issues.”  The scoreline flattered Federer in some ways. Both men eked out four break points over the two sets and Nieminen fought on level terms at the baseline, hitting eye-catching forehand winners throughout.  Federer’s mastery of the pivotal points of the match showed the steel behind the game’s most graceful player remained firmly in place and his preference for playing new tournaments is far from a retirement tour.  For the crucial break of the first set he came from 0-40 down in the fifth game and then saved a break point on his own serve to build a two-game cushion.  IMPERIOUS BEST  In the second stanza he immediately grabbed the initiative, breaking in the first game and with his serve at near its imperious best he never looked like letting the advantage slip.  “I expect myself to play a bit better in the next match, even though today was already very good for a first match in so many weeks,” Federer said.  “You don’t want to overrate, it but you also don’t want to underrate it.  “The worst thing that can happen is if you lose early and then you have to go back on the practice courts, and you think you’re actually playing okay and then the matches roll around and you don’t end up.”  The 17-times grand slam champion next meets Australian Marinko Matosevic, who beat Sam Querrey 5-7 7-6 (7-3) 6-4 in an entertaining match.

There was little sign of a more pronounced net-game in Federer’s 6-4 6-2 victory over Jarkko Nieminen at the Brisbane International on Wednesday and the Finn was able to blast passing shots wide of him when the Swiss did come forward.  “I’m really trying to get used to conditions here because it’s quite fast,” top seed Federer told reporters after winning at the Pat Rafter Arena.  “It’s actually hard when somebody hits deep into the court, when you’re half-volleying, to really come into the net so you want to almost do it on your terms.  “With your serve would be an idea, or with a second-serve chip and charge, or within the first couple shots of a point,” said four-times Australian Open winner Federer.  “On a slower court it’s almost easier to tell yourself. ‘I’m going to make my way to the net’.”  Federer’s childhood hero Edberg, also a former world number one, will accompany the 17-times major winner on an occasional basis this year after agreeing to work with him earlier this month.  “I’ve been practicing so much so it’s really about learning what’s been going well and not so well in the matches,” said Federer.  The Australian Open, the first of the year’s four grand slam events, begins on January 13." }

Protests have been staged by supporters of Islamist president Mohamed Mursi since the army removed him from office in July after mass protests against his rule.  On Wednesday, the state-run Al-Ahram website said about 300 university students from the Muslim Brotherhood had blocked a road near the Defense Ministry and chanted anti-police and army slogans.  “The police had to use water cannons and tear gas after the students refused to open the street and leave,” Ahram said adding some protesters were arrested.  Police also fired tear gas on pro-Mursi student protesters from the state’s main university in the Nile Delta city of Zakazik, Mursi’s home town.  Mursi’s removal opened the bloodiest chapter in Egypt’s modern history. Security forces have killed hundreds of his supporters, while around 400 soldiers and policemen have been killed, many in attacks by Islamist militants in the Sinai peninsula, bordering Israel and the Palestinian Gaza Strip.  Students supporting Mursi have been staging daily protests inside and outside their universities since the start of a new academic year in September. At least 10 students have been killed during clashes with the police.  Last November, Egypt’s army-installed interim government issued a law that banned protests near or originating from places of worship and made it compulsory to seek Interior Ministry permission to hold a demonstration.  Since the law was passed, hundreds of Brotherhood protesters and liberal activists have been arrested for demonstrating without permission." }

The central bank is struggling to curb inflation, which is expected to end the year around 7 percent, and support the lira currency, which lost 17 percent of its value against the U.S. dollar last year.  The country’s banking watchdog has proposed curbing consumers’ use of credit cards to pay for goods such as cars with monthly instalments, as a step to raise the domestic savings rate and reduce the nation’s dependence on foreign capital to finance consumption.  The consumption tax on passenger cars was raised by between 5 and 15 percentage points, depending on the size of engine, bringing it to a range of 45 to 145 percent.  The same tax was increased by 15 percent in lira terms on beer and 10 percent on other alcoholic beverages. The minimum tax on a packet of cigarettes was lifted to 3.75 lira ($1.75) from 3.22 lira, while the tax on mobile phones was raised to 120 lira from 100 lira, the official state publication said.

Lotus F1 Formula One driver Kimi Raikkonen of Finland walks on the track at the Suzuka circuit October 10, 2013, ahead of Sunday's Japanese F1 Grand Prix. REUTERS/Toru Hanai  The start of a new year marks both a new phase and a return for the ‘Iceman’, the 2007 world champion who is back in the red overalls of the Italian team he left in 2009 to make way for Fernando Alonso.  The 34-year-old has moved from Lotus to team up with Spaniard Alonso in the sport’s only current line-up of champions and has plenty of work to do with the first pre-season test in Jerez now only weeks away.  “Kimi will be extremely busy since the beginning of January to work in this strange machine that I don’t like at all, the simulator,” Montezemolo told reporters over a pre-Christmas lunch in Italy last month.  “It’s a joke. We have been forced to invest a huge amount of money in this terrible, artificial, machine instead of being allowed to test here (at Fiorano) and at Mugello.”  Montezemolo has long pushed for a return to in-season track testing, something which has been heavily limited as part of cost-saving measures, rather than relying on virtual technology.  Four two-day post-race tests in Europe are allowed this year but they replace an annual three-day young driver test and each team’s current allowance of eight days promotional track time.  Teams, who have had to reduce significantly the amount of wind tunnel testing they do before a cost cap is introduced next year, are working flat out on their new cars with the sport going through a rule change revolution.  The old 2.4-litre V8 engines have been ditched, with a new and less thirsty 1.6 liter V6 turbocharged power unit with energy recovery systems introduced in its place.  All drivers will have to come to terms with the new technology, and different ways of racing, and have already been putting in the laps around familiar circuits in their team simulators to get a taste of how the cars will handle.  Raikkonen, who underwent back surgery in November and missed the last two races of the 2013 season, is not big on them. This time last year, the Finn was widely quoted as saying he felt he could learn nothing in such a machine.  In 2012, ahead of his first Indian Grand Prix in his comeback season, he told reporters: “I’m not like other drivers, so I haven’t driven the simulator to learn it.”  TWO ROOSTERS  Raikkonen is expected to be first to try out the new car at Jerez, with last year’s runner-up Alonso joining the test later, and their partnership will be closely watched for signs of strain between the two.  Montezemolo, who once warned against having “two roosters in the same henhouse”, said he wanted two team players and assured reporters he was not worried.  “Putting together Alonso and Raikkonen could be dangerous. But in Formula One...everything is potential danger,” he said.  “I think that Fernando knows that he drives not for himself but for Ferrari. And Raikkonen knows that he is in the second half of his career, two very important years for him, with experience and responsibilities.”  Describing Raikkonen as a “very correct guy” who was fully motivated and concentrated, the Italian said the Finn’s talents would mean Alonso was no longer fighting a lone battle up front against his rivals and would have someone pushing him hard.  “(Team principal Stefano) Domenicali has spoken very clearly to both of them,” added Montezemolo.  “They have the honor and the responsibility to drive for Ferrari and every driver knows that he has to drive not for himself but for the team.  “If a driver wants to drive for himself, there are many possibilities. They can do their own team, they can go in a different team but in Ferrari these are the rules.”  Raikkonen remains Ferrari’s most recent world champion, with the sport’s most successful outfit finishing third overall last season behind champions Red Bull and runners-up Mercedes.  Alonso, champion with Renault in 2005 and 2006, has been runner-up to Red Bull’s Sebastian Vettel in three of the last four years." }

Down on Mexico’s Pacific coast, a drug gang was already making it a reality.  The Knights Templar cartel, steadily diversifying into other businesses, became so successful at exporting iron ore to China that the Mexican Navy in November had to move in and take over the port in Lazaro Cardenas, a city that has become one of the gang’s main cash generators.  This steelmaking center, drug smuggling hot spot and home of a rapidly growing container port in the western state of Michoacan occupies a strategic position on the Pacific coast, making it a natural gateway for burgeoning trade with China.  Lazaro Cardenas opened to container traffic just a decade ago, and with a harbor deep enough to berth the world’s largest ships, it already aims to compete with Los Angeles to handle Asian goods bound for the U.S. market.  But that future is in doubt unless the government can restore order and win its struggle with the Knights Templar, who took their name from a medieval military order that protected Christian pilgrims during the Crusades.  Mexico’s biggest producer of iron ore, Michoacan state is a magnet for Chinese traders feeding demand for steel in their homeland. But the mines also created an opportunity for criminal gangs, such as the Knights Templar, looking to broaden their revenue base into more legitimate businesses.  “The mines were mercilessly exploited, and the ore was leaving. But not in rafts or launches - it was going via the port, through customs, on ships,” said Michoachan’s governor, Fausto Vallejo, soon after the Navy occupied the port on Nov. 4.  Already a thriving criminal enterprise adept at corrupting local officials and squeezing payments from businesses, developers and farmers, the Knights took to mining with aplomb, according to entrepreneurs and miners working around the port.  Hidden behind mountain roads about an hour from Lazaro Cardenas, one small town mustered hundreds of trucks this year to lead the gang’s scramble to the port, a local miner said.  That town - Arteaga - is the birthplace of Servando Gomez, the former school teacher who leads the Knights Templar.  Gomez understood the potential of Lazaro Cardenas, which was a village best known for its coconuts until the government decided to build a steelworks there 40 years ago.  The gang’s trucks sped around Michoacan’s iron mines to supply Chinese buyers, helping to push ore exports to 4 million tonnes by October from 1-1.5 million tonnes a year previously.  Their business rests on several pillars, according to accounts of local officials, miners and entrepreneurs.  Firstly, the Knights controlled how the ore moved, having imposed protection charges on local transport unions after becoming the dominant gang in the city a few years ago.  It also helped local prospectors stake claims to mine areas either unclaimed by others or beyond the control of the existing concession-holders. Then the Knights took their cut.  Finally, the gang pressured customs officials to ensure the ore passed through the port smoothly.  “Most of the groups mining are Knights Templar or belong to them. They have the whole chain,” a local official told Reuters.  Fueled by the appetite of Chinese buyers, about half the mining in the area was done without proper permits this year, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Those who talk openly can pay dearly. In April, an official at steel maker ArcelorMittal who local businessmen said had reported illegal mining to authorities was shot dead.  One prospector from Arteaga, who asked to remain anonymous, said he ran a mine selling unprocessed iron ore to Chinese traders for $32 per tonne, giving him a profit of about $5-7 per tonne. By the time it reached China, the buyers could expect to sell the ore for a profit of around $15 per tonne, he estimated.  Because the Knights Templar control much of the local iron supply, the gang has pressured Chinese buyers to purchase ore from them or face reprisals, said a Mexican government security official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The combination of organized crime and Chinese buying of Mexican iron ore poses a problem for President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has gone out of his way to cultivate ties with China.  China’s President Xi Jinping has been in office only since March, but Pena Nieto has already met him three times. In June, Pena Nieto welcomed Xi to Mexico, signing a string of economic cooperation deals. But at the top of the agenda was how to narrow the massive trade imbalance between the two nations.  Bilateral trade was worth $62.7 billion in 2012, up from just $431 million two decades ago, Mexican data shows. But 90 percent is accounted for by Chinese exports to Mexico, most of it goods such as computers and component parts.  CHAOS, LOCKDOWN, MORE CHAOS  Much of that trade goes directly through Lazaro Cardenas.  In 2012, it had the biggest rise in traffic in North America’s 20 top container ports, handling 1.2 million 20-foot equivalent units, or teus.  Most of the port is still a dusty plain above which birds of prey soar in stifling heat. In a few years, though, projects started by Maersk-unit APM Terminals and Hutchison Port Holdings could expand its capacity to about 8 million teus - the amount moved in 2012 by the continent’s top container hub, Los Angeles.  But Michoacan is not California.  Seven years ago, then-President Felipe Calderon began a nationwide crackdown on organized crime in Michoacan, sending in the army to tackle increasingly violent drug cartels.  Over 80,000 people have since died in gang-related killings across Mexico, and assurances Pena Nieto gave that he would stop the rot when he took power a year ago are wearing thin.  Although parts of Mexico have become safer since Pena Nieto took office, Michoacan has fallen into even more chaos.  Over half of the state lives in poverty. Traditional work like resin production is dying out due to competition from China and elsewhere. That creates new recruits for organized crime.  In October, a local bishop likened Michoacan to a failed state. A few days later, assailants temporarily knocked out power for hundreds of thousands in the state with a string of attacks on installations of the national electricity utility.  Many blamed the Knights, though signs posted in Michoacan accused a small rival gang of staging the attack.  The Navy took over the port authority and reinforced Lazaro Cardenas shortly afterward. All the local police and customs officials were initially suspended and the caravans of trucks carting ore started to thin out.  But the lull is unlikely to last unless the government can regain control of the city beyond the port gates and open up mining to legitimate prospectors not controlled by the gang.  Miners complain that the main concession-holders such as ArcelorMittal, which did not respond to requests for comment, use only a fraction of their land and are reluctant to let others mine it. The Knights have turned that dispute into money.  Days after the Navy moved in, state governor Vallejo said criminal enterprise around Lazaro Cardenas could be worth up to $2 billion a year - or about half Michoacan’s 2012 budget.  ‘EVERYONE IS PAYING’  Some involved in the mining industry say the area has become safer since the Knights Templar started to take control.  But the facts suggest otherwise: government figures show kidnappings in Michoacan reached a record level in 2013, and murders climbed to a 15-year peak.  Gomez has appeared in several YouTube videos trying to portray his Knights Templar as defenders of Michoacan.  In one posted in August, he said the Knights had provided paid protection at the request of avocado farmers but that they did not extort businesses. However, he also conceded that some “foolish” members of his gang probably had engaged in extortion.  The Knights’ power in Lazaro Cardenas is often subtle.  Unlike parts of northern Mexico living under the threat of violence, the restaurants, taco stands and bars on the city’s main palm-lined boulevard are alive with people as night falls.  Some residents say they are not squeezed by the cartel, and big companies say they can operate without fear of extortion.  “We don’t pay a cent to anyone,” said Jose Zozaya, head of Kansas City Southern Mexico, which operates the rail link that connects the port with the United States.  But others quickly vent their anger about the Knights.  “Everyone is paying, but they won’t tell you,” said a local entrepreneur. “The people here are destroyed.”  The port is no stranger to crime, and during Calderon’s presidency it became a big entry point for chemicals from China and other parts of Asia used to make methamphetamine. Some locals say chemicals have even been used to pay gangs for the iron ore.  Asked if Mexico had discussed the iron ore issue with Beijing, a senior government official said: “The Chinese government doesn’t always know what the companies are doing. The occupation of the port ... was the control measure adopted.”  Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, said she was unaware of the situation in Lazaro Cardenas, adding: “But I can tell you that the Chinese government has consistently educated and asked Chinese companies to respect the law in other countries when they carry out business and trade cooperation.”  Successful Chinese firms are growing quickly in the region.  Since setting up in 2009, Desarrollo Minero Unificado de Mexico (DMU), a Chinese iron mining company in Lazaro Cardenas, has gone from three employees to 600 nationwide, nearly all of them Mexicans, Director General Luis Lu told Reuters.  With more than 30 concessions, Lu said his company mined all of its own iron and had not had any trouble with organized crime. He said he could not say how other Chinese firms fared.  Still, Chinese success in Michoacan has caused friction with the Knights Templar. In the August YouTube video, gang leader Gomez had some strong words for them.  “We have an excessive invasion of Chinese. An excess of Chinese,” he said, surrounded by armed men. “It may suit the interests of various corporations, I don’t know. But they’re here with us now. And these people have their mafias too.”" }

The pontiff, who took his papal name from St Francis of Assisi, the saint most associated with peace, urged the world to listen to the “cry for peace” from suffering peoples.  “What on earth is happening in the hearts of men? What on earth is happening in the heart of humanity?” he said to tens of thousands of people in St Peter’s Square on the day the Roman Catholic Church celebrates its World Day of Peace.  “It’s time to stop!” he said, departing from his prepared text.  Francis was speaking from the window of the Apostolic Palace overlooking St. Peter’s Square that popes traditionally use for their addresses.  Unlike his predecessors, Francis has not used the spacious apartment behind the window since his election in March, shunning pomp and preferring instead to live in small quarters in a Vatican guest house.  “Everyone must be committed to building a society that is truly just and caring,” he told the crowd on Wednesday, acknowledging the many peace banners and blue balloons held aloft.  In a message for the World Day of Peace sent to world leaders last month, Francis said that huge salaries and bonuses were symptoms of an economy based on greed and inequality  In that letter, the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Argentina again urged nations to narrow the gap between rich and poor, more and more of whom were getting only “crumbs”.  Francis, named Person of the Year by Time magazine and a number of other publications, has urged his own Church to set an example by being more fair and frugal and less pompous, and to get closer to the poor and afflicted.  The new year is expected to bring concrete changes to the Vatican, plagued by a series of mishaps and scandals under Pope Benedict XVI, who in February became the first pontiff to resign in 600 years.  Francis has appointed a committee of eight cardinals from around the world to advise him on how to reform the central Vatican administration.  He has also named commissions to advise him on what to do with the scandal-plagued Vatican bank, on transparency in other parts of Vatican finance and on how to deal with the Church’s many sexual abuse scandals.  Slideshow (2 Images)  Vatican officials expect changes to start taking shape in late February, when his council of advisors has a pivotal meeting in the Vatican.  On February 22, Francis will name his first batch of cardinals to join the exclusive group that will one day choose his successor.  The names of the new cardinals are expected to be disclosed sometime in late January, and will offer another indication of the type of humbler Church that Francis wants." }

Spain exited a recession in the third quarter of last year but the economy is still sickly and with unemployment officially predicted at 25.9 percent in 2014, roughly where it is now, there is little perception of a real recovery on the streets.

The country is still reeling from a decade-long housing bubble which burst more than five years ago, forcing a 41-billion euro ($56 billion) bailout of the country’s banks, which were glutted with property debt.

However one think tank has said the changes fail to tackle Spain’s notoriously two-tiered labor market, with security for long-term fixed contracts and practically none for shorter-term ones.

Robinson’s camp has filed nearly 300 separate complaints to the court, his campaign team said.  Turnout among Madagascar’s 7.9 million registered voters was just over 50 percent, the CENIT said.  Educated in Canada, 55-year-old Rajaonarimampianina pitched himself as best-placed to marshal a recovery of Madagascar’s economy, which is struggling to regain foreign interest in its oil, nickel, chrome, iron ore and coal deposits.

A Muslim pilgrim prays atop Mount Thor in the holy city of Mecca ahead of the annual haj pilgrimage October 11, 2013. REUTERS/Ibraheem Abu Mustafa  All shops in Saudi Arabia, the birthplace of Islam and the world’s top oil exporter, are supposed to shut for half an hour during the daily Muslim prayers, which take place at dawn, midday, mid afternoon, sunset and evening.  However, Al al-Sheikh, a moderate appointed to the post a year ago, said he did not think they needed to close for such a long period, in comments on television carried in the English-language daily Arab News, which is owned by a leading prince.  Al al-Sheikh added that Muslim shop staff could pray at their places of work rather than having to spend time walking to the mosque and back.  The comments are the latest sign of Al al-Sheikh’s attempts to improve the image of the morality police, officially known as the Commission for the Promotion of Virtue and the Prevention of Vice.  King Abdullah appointed him a year ago after a clip went viral on YouTube showing a morality police patrol harassing a family in a shopping mall.  The organization enforces the kingdom’s rigid interpretation of Islamic law, including strict gender segregation, modest dress and restrained public behavior.  In 2002 it triggered international outrage when its officers prevented schoolgirls leaving a burning building because they were not wearing veils, leading to several deaths.  Its officers have also been accused inside Saudi Arabia of taking the law into their own hands.  “I will continue with the most moderate and tolerant view to lead this organization,” he was quoted as saying by Arab News.  King Abdullah is praised by his supporters as having introduced cautious social and economic reforms designed to modernize ultra-conservative Saudi Arabia without causing social unrest.  Some of the monarch’s critics say these changes merely provide an illusion of reform while the political system in which the ruling family shares power with conservative Muslim clerics, remains unaltered." }

The European Jewish Congress (EJC) offered on Tuesday to help European soccer’s governing body UEFA and the English FA to fight anti-Semitism in the sport following Nicolas Anelka’s “quenelle” salute.  It has also called on the soccer authorities to ban Anelka, 34, who is being investigated by the English FA, for the gesture.  The former France striker celebrated the first of the two goals he scored in West Bromwich Albion’s 3-3 draw at West Ham United on Saturday by making the gesture, made famous by the French comedian Dieudonne, which is linked to anti-Semitism.  The 34-year-old Anelka promised his club on Monday he would not repeat it in future.  But EJC president Doctor Moshe Kantor has written to both Michel Platini, the UEFA president, and Greg Dyke, the chairman of the English FA, saying what Anelka did means there can be no let-up in the fight to keep anti-Semitism out of soccer.  “We offer the co-operation of the European Jewish Congress and are ready to discuss practical ideas and suggestions for combating anti-Semitism and racism in football,” said Kantor, who called for Anelka to be banned.  “There is an urgent need for action to confront this phenomenon as it relates to football and we stand ready to assist you in combating this intolerable hate.  “At the European Jewish Congress, we regularly receive reports of attacks on Jews, whether verbal or physical, which also include acts of anti-Semitism at matches involving English and European football clubs,” he added.  “Mr Anelka’s recent action is a reminder that hatred of Jews in the stands can very easily find its way right on to the pitch.  “Similarly, the legitimization of anti-Semitic acts by players who are supposed to act as role models for youth is a particularly dangerous phenomenon, and one that is not restricted to Mr. Anelka alone.”  Thousands of photographs have emerged on the internet showing people using the quenelle in what the EJC calls “sensitive sites” like the Auschwitz death camp, the Anne Frank House in Amsterdam and in front of the Toulouse Jewish school where four people, including three school children, were massacred last March.  “This amply demonstrates that the salute is a means of provocation towards Jews,” added Kantor.  The FA, UEFA and world governing body FIFA, have long worked closely with anti-racism organizations like FARE (Football Against Racism in Europe) and the English “Kick It Out” campaign to fight against racism, anti-Semitism and homophobia in soccer.

More than 2 million people enrolled in private plans offered under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, during the initial sign-up period for health benefits starting Jan. 1. Enrollment began in October and lasts through March, but Americans in most states had to enroll by last week to get coverage that takes effect with the start of the new year.  The expansion of coverage through the new plans is one of the signature parts of the 2010 law, which is the most sweeping U.S. social legislation in 50 years. Over time, the law - which requires most Americans to buy insurance, offers subsidies to help low-income people get covered and sets minimum standards for coverage - aims to dramatically reduce the number of Americans who lack health insurance, which the U.S. government has estimated at more than 45 million.  After a difficult October launch plagued by problems with the website used to enroll people in coverage, the focus now for the government and healthcare providers has turned to what will happen beginning Wednesday, when patients with the new coverage start to seek care.  At the start, confirming a patient’s plan may present headaches for care providers. The Obama administration has acknowledged that errors occurred in transmitting enrollment data to insurers, especially early in the enrollment period.  Although government officials say they have dramatically improved the process, healthcare providers are concerned about problems or delays in verifying coverage with insurers.  “It will be difficult for us to actually verify coverage - that’s my concern,” said Dr. William Wulf, CEO of Central Ohio Primary Care, which has 250 primary care physicians.  The task could be made more difficult by decisions by the U.S. government and many states to push back enrollment deadlines toward the end of the year, and to allow some patients well into January to pay for coverage that is retroactive to the start of the year.  The late deadlines mean that many enrollees who seek care initially may lack insurance cards or other proof of coverage.  Wulf said his physician offices will assume that an existing patient is covered if they claim to be when they come in for appointments and their coverage cannot be verified immediately. But if they require expensive tests, such as MRIs or heart-stress tests that can cost up to $700, the Ohio practice will check with insurers first to make sure the patient has coverage.  Similarly, Dr. Andy Chiou, CEO of Peoria Surgical Group Ltd in Illinois, said that if the practice finds a “significant minority” of its patients do not have coverage when they believe they do, it might delay elective surgeries for patients until their insurance is confirmed.  “For the protection of patients and us, we’ll have to say, ‘Sorry, you don’t have insurance,’” Chiou said.  POLITICAL STAKES HIGH  For the Obama administration, the political stakes are high in ensuring a smooth transition period for coverage, particularly after the website’s problems damaged the popularity of the Democratic president and the healthcare overhaul, his top domestic achievement.  Republicans who have called Obamacare a costly program that will rob many Americans of insurance choices have said they will make Obamacare’s problems their top issue in the November 2014 elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.  White House health policy adviser Phil Schiliro said on Tuesday that because of the intense focus on Obamacare, “problems that have never gotten attention before will get some attention now.”  The U.S. government has tried to anticipate the coverage problems new enrollees might encounter. The federally run Healthcare.Gov website last week posted advice on what enrollees should do if they have not received an insurance card, encounter problems getting coverage for a drug prescription, or need to appeal a decision by an insurer.  “For consumers whose marketplace coverage begins on January 1, we’re doing everything we can to help ensure a smooth transition period,” Kathleen Sebelius, the U.S. secretary of health and human services, said in blog posting on Tuesday.  “What we are stressing to folks is that if they get to a provider (and) there is some confusion (about coverage), call their insurer,” Schiliro said. “If the insurer is not able to resolve it, they should call our toll-free number (800-318-2596) ... and operators will be there 24/7.”  Some healthcare companies are trying to get ahead of potential problems as well.  The pharmacy chain Walgreen Co said on Monday that it would allow consumers who have not yet received a plan identification number from their insurer to get prescriptions at no upfront cost in January, if they can provide evidence of their coverage or pharmacy staff can otherwise confirm it.  Wal-Mart on Tuesday said it would institute a similar practice.  HOSPITALS READY FOR CHANGE  Hospital executives, meanwhile, said they were ready for potential hiccups with the newly insured.  The vast majority of Americans have employer-based coverage and Medicare plans and can choose new plans every January, so executives said the beginning of the Obamacare plans represented a more intense version of an insurance transition period they already are familiar with.  “Hospitals feel like they’re pretty well prepared because they’ve had systems in place and tools in place to work through these sorts of issues,” said Jeff Goldman, vice president of coverage policy for the American Hospital Association. “We expect an uptick in volume, but we don’t think it’s anything beyond what most hospitals are prepared to handle.”  As many as 7 million people were expected to sign up for coverage in the Obamacare plans for 2014, but enrollment so far is well short of that figure largely because of the problems with the HealthCare.gov website. Residents of 36 states use the site to enroll; those in the other 14 states use state-run websites. Hospitals, therefore, may have been preparing for more new enrollees than they are likely to see at this point.  At New York’s Montefiore Medical Center, staffers were trained on how the new healthcare plans work in part so they can help patients resolve any coverage issues, said Lynn Richmond, the medical center’s chief of staff.  “There’s not a lot of active worry on our part,” Richmond said. “We feel ready to manage the hiccups.”  Indeed, many have eagerly anticipated the law’s broadening of coverage. Across the nation, hospital operators’ finances have been weighed down by patients who have been unable to pay their bills because they lacked sufficient insurance.  “We’re looking forward to the first quarter and beyond because we feel we’re in a very good position to benefit from the ACA,” said Steven Campanini, a spokesman for Tenet Healthcare Corp, one of the largest publicly traded hospital chains." }

People shop inside a Target store during Black Friday sales in the Brooklyn borough of New York, November 29, 2013. REUTERS/Eric Thayer  A lot of stores had to discount heavily to eke out a modest increase in sales, likely squeezing profit margins in the process.  Some improvement in the U.S. economy and declines in the jobless rate, plus gains in stock and home prices, are failing to resonate with many Americans whose incomes are struggling to catch up to where they were before the financial crisis.  But to many retail experts and economists there are other less cyclical factors at play. Consumers are spending more. Government figures show monthly personal consumption has risen for seven straight months, with November’s outlay marking the fastest increase in five months. But they just are not spending in the shopping malls like they used to.  And that means that, even if the economy picks up significantly, retailers of many products could still struggle.  “We are in a something of an evolutionary process, said Bill Martin, founder of data firm ShopperTrak, which monitors foot traffic in about 60,000 retail stores. Americans are spending more online and becoming more careful about what they buy, he said.  Some of this has been unfolding over a long period, although the changes might be picking up pace.  For example, department stores have found themselves on the wrong end of trends for some time. According to data compiled by Reuters, they now capture just $3.37 of every $100 of U.S. retail spending, the lowest since records began in 1992, when the number was nearly $9.  Some of that is explained by the rise of Wal-Mart Stores Inc and other big box discount retailers. But the pace of decline has picked up, with department stores losing about 0.28 percentage points of market share at an annualized rate between 2002 and 2011, compared with 0.22 in the prior 10 years.  The problem is two-fold. The middle class consumers to whom the likes of JC Penney Co Inc and Kohl’s Corp cater have struggled with stagnant wages and a payroll tax rise, prompting them to reduce spending on apparel, said Scott Tuhy, a retail analyst at Moody’s Investors Service in New York.  People have also gravitated toward spending on services such as travel - airline ticket prices and hotel room rates are up - as well as movie downloads and other content for their TVs, smart phones and tablets. Prices to attend live sports events, theme parks, movies and rock concerts have also been rising.  In addition, increasing healthcare costs have been eating up discretionary income, with many employers seeking higher contributions from their staff.  According to the Commerce Department, spending on services hit an annual rate of $7.1 trillion in November, by far the biggest slice of overall consumption  “There was a day you bought your TV, refrigerator, furniture, everything in a department store, whereas today, it’s really just apparel and maybe jewelry,” said Stuart Hoffman, an economist at PNC Financial Services Group in Pittsburgh. “But as incomes rise over time, people spend more on services - travel, entertainment.”  As data from MasterCard showed last week, it took deep discounts and hefty promotions to spur a 2.3 percent rise in holiday sales between November 1 and December 24 compared with a year earlier. The figures include apparel, jewelry, electronics, luxury goods and home furnishings.  “Given how promotional the season turned out to be, profits are likely to be flat because retailers had to provide quite a lot of discounts to get those sales,” said Moody’s Tuhy.  And it’s not as if people aren’t doing some serious shopping.  U.S. sales of big-ticket items such as autos and home-related goods such as washing machines, as well as purchases in home-improvement stores, surged in 2013, boosting overall retail sales. Homes sales also increased pretty steadily from mid-2012, although a summer spike in mortgage rates cooled things off a bit this fall.  Some of the gains reflected a long-anticipated release of pent-up demand as the economic recovery has gained momentum, but it might also be partly a reflection of changing attitudes, with the focus on more practical purchases.  According to the National Association of Realtors, more than half of home buyers between July 2012 and June 2013 made some sacrifices, such as reducing spending on luxury items, entertainment and clothing.  “Pent-up demand has helped on housing and autos, but consumers are still cautious. Things are getting better, yes, but even if you have a job, things are still tight,” said Sam Bullard, an economist at Wells Fargo in Charlotte.  In its 2014 retail industry outlook, Moody’s said it expects the auto and home improvement sectors to outperform again in 2014, good news for Home Depot Inc and General Motors Co, whose stocks are up 32 percent and 41 percent, respectively, this year.  It’s been a different story with more ordinary purchases.  An Ipsos/Reuters poll released just ahead of the Christmas holiday found consumers plan to spend about a third less this year than last year on items such as jewelry, toys and electronics.  Sluggish sales of toys and packaged foods pushed down sales at Wal-Mart’s U.S. stores in the third quarter and prompted the company to forecast disappointing holiday sales results, while Target Corp blamed “constrained” consumer spending for a tepid rise in quarterly sales.  One factor is that the giant TV is much cheaper than it was, and tablets and many of today’s laptop and desktop PCs are cheaper than their predecessors of a few years ago, again not helping store sales. Shoppers are also increasingly likely to buy such items online from the likes of Amazon.com Inc and Apple Inc.  Participants in Deloitte’s 2013 holiday shopping survey for the first time named the Internet as their number one shopping venue, with 68 percent of smart phone users and 63 percent of tablet users planning to use their devices to help them.  As people check out goods online before heading to the store  impulse buying can take a hit, said Martin. ShopperTrak data shows mall shoppers visited an average of 3 to 3-1/2 stores this year, down from 4-1/2 to 5 in 2007.  The improvement in the economy and gains in asset prices have also clearly not trickled down to large segments of the broader population.  Hiring has picked up, helping to push the jobless rate to a five-year low of 7 percent in November, but some 11 million Americans are still unemployed, and many are earning less than before the recession. When adjusted for inflation, average weekly wages have barely budged since late 2008.  That has made Americans, particularly those in middle- and lower-income brackets, far more discerning when it comes to their spending.  “There’s been psychological scarring for people from this recession, much like how some people who lived through the Depression said they were scarred,” said Hoffman. “There are still a lot of people who can’t afford to do much, and those who can are holding back.”" }

Musharraf, who did not appear in court, says the trial is a politically motivated vendetta.  His lawyers say Musharraf cannot get a fair trial in Pakistan because of his history of disputes with the judiciary and the involvement of Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif whom he once overthrew in a coup.  “I would go beyond (the accusation of) bias. This is a fraud on the law,” said defense lawyer Anwar Mansoor Khan.  Musharraf ousted Sharif in a coup in 1999. Sharif was jailed for a period and then forced into exile. He returned eight years later and won a landslide victory in a general election in May.  Musharraf himself stepped down in 2008 to avoid impeachment charges after judges and lawyers led street protests over his attempt to fire the then-chief justice.  The trial opened on December 24 but was immediately suspended after Musharraf did not appear because a bag of explosives was found on his route to the court. Another bag of explosives was found near his house on Wednesday.  Police told the judge they had deployed more than 1,000 officers to secure his route, but “yet again there was a bomb scare”, judge Faisal Arab said.  Khan said the defense had “zero confidence” in the police and said a mysterious unmarked car had tried to force him off the road.  ARMY SUPPORT  Musharraf returned to Pakistan last year, hoping to contest elections that marked the first democratic transfer of power from one civilian government to another in coup-prone Pakistan’s history.  Instead, he was barred from standing and enmeshed in a web of legal cases, repeatedly charged and bailed.  In recent days, Musharraf has said in media interviews that the whole army supported him and was upset about his treatment. He also acknowledged that before his return to Pakistan, the army sent a top envoy to try to dissuade him from coming back.  The military is Pakistan’s most powerful institution and it has ruled the country for more than half its history since independence in 1947.  But in recent years the civilian government and judiciary have both become more assertive. Top military officers have been questioned although not convicted in human rights and corruption cases.  The military leadership has given no indication it intends to intervene in the trial of Musharraf who was likely to be overstating the army’s support for him to help with his legal troubles, said retired general Talat Masood.  Slideshow (3 Images)  “He’s trying to twist facts in order to suit his case, to get sympathy and support,” he said. “These are tactics to protect and shield himself from the legal process.”  Masood said if the case was handled fairly, it could even strengthen relations between the government and military.  “This is a test of civil-military relations,” he said. “It is just one instance of the civil government trying to assert itself.”" }

Scalfari, who held a long private conversation with the pope earlier this year and wrote about it several times, concluded in the complex, treatise-like article that Francis believed sin effectively no longer existed because God’s mercy and forgiveness were “eternal”.

It was not the first brush between the Vatican and Scalfari, who founded La Repubblica newspaper in 1976.  Last month the Vatican removed from its website the text of Scalfari’s transcript of his conversation with the pope, saying parts of it were not reliable.

Concern among churches worldwide for fellow Christians in the Middle East has risen in recent years as wars and Islamist rebels have killed or driven many from their homes there. The Jeddah-based OIC’s religious diplomacy was long focused on a fruitless effort to have the United Nations pass a global ban on insults to Islam. The fate of Christian minorities in Muslim countries rarely figured in its declarations.  “I have no doubt that there is room for religious freedom improvements in some parts of the Muslim world with regard to allowing non-Muslims to have access to their religious facilities or construction of such facilities,” Ihsanoglu wrote in response to questions by email from Reuters.  Christians in the Middle East frequently complain of restrictions or bans on churches there and their leaders, alarmed by the rise of hardline Islamists in the wake of Arab Spring uprisings, have tried to emphasise their long histories in the region and have urged their communities not to leave.  At his December 13 Vatican meeting with Pope Francis, Ihsanoglu said he stressed the need for “greater efforts from OIC member states to foster respect for religious pluralism and cultural diversity and to counter the spread of bigotry and prejudice”.

Kehm urged journalists to respect the 44-year-old German’s privacy after security guards said they intercepted a reporter disguised as a priest trying to get into Schumacher’s room.  “Security got him before he came close ... I don’t want to go into details of what exactly we are doing security-wise.

Charlotte is 0-2 on a five-game road trip and has lost four of its last five overall.  Rivers termed it as “delusional” on Tuesday that some Clippers think the squad is among the hunted NBA teams. “I mean, c’mon. If we think we’re the hunted, they have no idea what the hunted is,” Rivers told reporters in his strongly worded rebuke. “I’ve been on a hunted team before and that’s the year after you win a title.

The Scarlet Knights won three of their first four, lost six of the next seven and come into their meeting with Temple off two straight victories.  Both teams have shown the ability to put up points, but are the bottom two in the league in scoring defense and in the bottom half in field goal percentage defense.

The Pacers survived a tough shooting effort in a 91-76 home win over Cleveland on Tuesday, maintaining the best record in the Eastern Conference and improving to a staggering 11-3 in games in which they have trailed at halftime. The Raptors continue their strong play since trading Rudy Gay to Sacramento, rallying for an 85-79 win at Chicago on Tuesday to climb within one game of .500.

All they have to do is find a way around the visiting Dallas Mavericks on Wednesday. The Wizards are winners of five of their last six games and are averaging 105.2 points in that span behind strong play from point guard John Wall and backcourt mate Bradley Beal.  Washington is showing promise on defense as well and held the Detroit Pistons to 12 fourth-quarter points in a 106-99 win on Monday. “We played with heart and we played simple,” forward Martell Webster said. “You can do all the drills you want to play defense, but at the end of the day it all relies on how much heart you have.” The Wizards will need plenty of that heart to stop the Mavericks, who have hit the century mark in eight straight games.  TV: 6 p.m. ET, FSN Southwest (Dallas), CSN Mid-Atlantic (Washington)  ABOUT THE MAVERICKS (18-13): Dallas took the first two of its three-game road trip, including a controversial 100-98 victory at Minnesota on Monday. Shawn Marion topped 30 points for the first time since 2008-09 with 32 but appeared to foul Kevin Love on a 3-point attempt at the buzzer - a foul that went uncalled but was admitted by the NBA on Tuesday. Foul or not, the Mavericks came away with the victory and have won two straight behind Marion. “The last two games I think you can tell he’s confident,” Monta Ellis said of Marion. “I think he’s more tuned in of being disrespected by other teams leaving him that way, so he’s been working on his game and it’s paying off the last two games.”  ABOUT THE WIZARDS (14-14): Washington is focused on moving past .500 and climbing up the standings in the Eastern Conference. “That’ll mean a lot for us,” Beal told CSN Washington. “The biggest thing we want to do is get over that, not just get to it. We’re more than capable of doing that. We just got to be able to get over that hump. Once we get there, we got to just push forward and continue playing the way we’ve played these last couple of games.” The Wizards’ hot streak coincides with Beal’s return to the lineup on Dec. 16, and the second-year guard is putting up 14.5 points and shooting 54.2 percent from 3-point range in the last six games.  BUZZER BEATERS  1. The Mavericks have taken seven straight in the series by an average of 7.3 points.  2. Wall has scored 20 or more points in a career-high seven straight games.  3.

Thai police officers gather at the Royal Plaza near the Government House in Bangkok December 30, 2013. REUTERS/Chaiwat Subprasom  Demonstrators who accuse Yingluck of being the puppet of her self-exiled brother, former premier Thaksin Shinawatra, have vowed to occupy government ministries and other key sites in Bangkok in their bid to scuttle a snap February 2 election.  The protests since late November have pitted the brother and sister’s political machine with its base among the rural poor in the north against Bangkok’s conservative elite.  It has flared into sporadic violence, and army chief General Prayuth Chan-Ocha refused to rule out a coup after wild clashes outside an election registration center a week ago. Three people have been killed since Thursday.  Yingluck, who is caretaker leader after calling the snap poll in a bid to defuse the crisis, had spent more than a week outside Bangkok shoring up support in the north but returned to the capital early on Wednesday.  She joined Prayuth and other senior military leaders in paying their respects to retired general Prem Tinsulanonda, the president of King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s Privy Council. Prayuth’s warning last week was a sobering reminder that the military has staged or attempted 18 coups in 81 years.  In a New Year message aired overnight, Thailand’s revered King Bhumibol urged peace, prosperity and unity among Thais.  “Everyone’s wishes do not seem to be very different, either for their own sake or for the peace of the country,” he said.  Wednesday’s largely ceremonial duties were a prelude to what are shaping as rougher days ahead for Yingluck, whose Puea Thai Party normally would be expected to win the election.  The demonstrators, led by fiery former deputy premier Suthep Thaugsuban, have vowed to derail the ballot and demand instead an appointed “people’s council” before a future vote.  Suthep has vowed to seize ministries and other sites across the capital, although it is not clear when that will start. The main opposition Democrat Party has also declared it will boycott the election.  Thailand’s Electoral Commission has offered to act as a mediator between Puea Thai, the Democrats and the protesters. Commissioner Somchai Srisuthiyakorn said the commission would meet senior members of Puea Thai and the Democrats on Thursday, although he said the protesters had rejected a similar offer.  “I believe that something positive will come out of the meeting and the situation will ease up,” Thai media quoted Somchai as saying.  While the protests have mainly been in Bangkok, election registration has also been blocked in at least seven provinces in the south, where the protesters and Democrats draw support.  The wider aim of the protesters is to neutralize the power of Thaksin, who they say has manipulated democracy by buying the support of the rural poor with populist policies such as cheap healthcare and subsidies for rice farmers.  Thaksin was overthrown in a 2006 coup and fled into exile two years later to avoid jail for graft charges he said were politically motivated. In November, Puea Thai tried to push through an amnesty bill that would have allowed Thaksin to return a free man, sparking the latest round of protests." }

The market expects the central bank to cut its key policy rates to multi-year lows on Thursday to stimulate economic growth.  The spot rupee closed at 130.65/75 per dollar, slightly firmer from Tuesday’s close of 130.75/90.  “There was forward selling by banks ahead of the rate announcement, expecting at least 50-basis-points cut (in the key policy rates),” a currency dealer said on condition of anonymity.  Yields on treasury bills fell to their lowest since Nov. 11, 2011 at a weekly auction on Wednesday and dealers said the reduction also added pressure on the rupee forward premiums.  Dealers said the three-month forward premium fell by 30 cents while six-month and one-year forward premiums dropped by around 50 cents and 20 cents respectively.  Dealers expect the currency to appreciate in the first quarter of 2014 due to a possible dollar bond inflow, before falling due to lower interest rates pressurising the exchange rate amid a pick-up in importer dollar demand.  The local currency has gained about 3.3 percent since it hit a record low of 135.20 on Aug. 28. It has lost 2.5 percent in 2013 following a 10.7 percent depreciation in 2012.

A girl hooks an Ema or a small wooden plaque, on which her wishes are written, at the Yasukuni Shrine in Tokyo January 1, 2014. REUTERS/Yuya Shino  Internal Affairs Minister Yoshitaka Shindo said he thought his visit to the Yasukuni Shrine was unlikely to become a diplomatic issue, Kyodo news agency reported.  But Beijing and Seoul have repeatedly expressed anger over politicians’ visits to Yasukuni, where Japanese leaders convicted as war criminals by an Allied tribunal after World War Two are honored along with those who died in battle.  Both China and Korea suffered under Japanese rule, with parts of China occupied from the 1930s and Korea colonized from 1910 to 1945. Japanese leaders have apologized in the past but many in China and South Korea doubt the sincerity of the apologies, partly because of contradictory remarks by politicians.  China condemned Wednesday’s visit, which it said exposed Japan’s war crimes and attempts to “challenge the outcomes of the world’s anti-fascist war”.  “The Chinese people and people of other Asian nations will not allow Japan to drive history in reverse. We solemnly urge Japan to reflect upon history and change course,” Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said in a statement posted on the ministry’s website.  Underscoring the deteriorating ties between Asia’s two biggest economies, China said its leaders would not meet Abe after he visited Yasukuni on Thursday, the first visit by a serving Japanese prime minister since 2006.  A commentary in China’s ruling Communist Party’s top newspaper called Abe’s actions a threat to peace in the region.  “Abe paying homage at the Yasukuni Shrine is an offensive, open provocation, and announces to the world his old imperial dreams. The international community must strike back strongly and be on guard for the ashes of Japan’s militarism to reignite,” the paper said.  Ties between Japan and China were already precarious due to a simmering row over ownership of a group of uninhabited islands in the East China Sea.  China has said it is willing to talk to Japan about the issue, but has accused Abe of not being serious about wanting to resolve the dispute.  Abe, a staunch conservative, has called for dialogue with China since returning to power a year ago, but Beijing had shown no inclination to respond to those overtures even before the latest Yasukuni controversy.  Experts see his visit as an attempt to recast Japan’s wartime past in a less apologetic light and revive national pride." }

Delek Drilling, one of the Leviathan partners, said on Wednesday the group was in “advanced negotiations” with the Israel Antitrust Authority to receive the regulator’s approval for their operations in return for selling their stakes in the Tanin and Karish fields.  The company in a separate statement said they were still in talks with Australia’s Woodside Petroleum to finalise a $1.25 billion deal announced in late 2012 to buy a 30 percent stake in Leviathan, the world’s largest offshore gas find of the past decade.  Woodside has said it expects to make a final decision on Leviathan in the first half of 2014.

Delek Drilling and Avner are subsidiaries of Delek Group.  Israel financial daily Calcalist reported that if an agreement is reached, the companies will have 2.5-4 years to sell their stakes in Tanin and Karish.  “At this stage it is only about negotiations and there is no certainty that the negotiations will lead to a binding agreement,” Delek Drilling said.

REUTERS/Tyrone Siu  Beijing had promised direct elections in the former British colony as the goal for 2017, but the devil is in the details of the rules governing who can run.  Pressure has been building between democratic forces in the financial hub, which returned to Chinese rule in 1997, and China’s stability-obsessed Communist Party leaders who fear a rival democrat being voted into office.  Protesters at the annual New Year’s Day democracy rally shouted slogans demanding full democracy in 2017, with a key condition being the open nominations of candidates so that anyone, including China critics, can run for office.  But Chinese officials and leftist newspapers have rejected that, citing the city’s mini-constitution that states all nominees must be endorsed by a 1,200-strong election committee, which is stacked with Beijing loyalists.  “There’s more and more interference (from Beijing),” said Tsang Fan-yu, a designer who was at Wednesday’s protest with his seven-year-old son for their sixth consecutive year.  “We have to come out to make our voices heard. The form of democracy Beijing wants is unacceptable. It’s fake.”  A cluster of banners read “Real Universal Suffrage. No pre-screened election”, while protesters also called on the city’s embattled and pro-Beijing leader, Leung Chun-ying, to step down after a series of scandals.  “We want to see Hong Kong people have a genuine choice in electing their leaders,” said Anson Chan, a respected former head of the civil service, who was at the rally.  Discord over the city’s democratic future could culminate in a protest this summer called “Occupy Central”, seeking to shut down the central business district of one of Asia’s most important financial centers.  “No direct election? See you in Central!” read one of the banners.  A New Year civil referendum was also launched to gauge the public’s preferences for the 2017 poll, with some 50,000 Hong Kong residents having voted by late afternoon.  “Hong Kong’s political future has now come to a critical moment,” said Johnson Yeung, one of the rally organizers. “The 2014 New Year’s Day rally will become the first field of battle between the public and the government.”" }

Putin flew in before dawn, after vowing in a New Year address to “annihilate” terrorists in uncompromising remarks aimed at Islamist insurgents based in the North Caucasus who have plagued his 14-year rule.  “No matter what motivated the criminals, there can be no justification for crimes against civilians, particularly against women and children,” Putin said in televised comments at the start of a meeting with senior security officials.  “The vileness of the crime - or crimes - that were committed here, in Volgograd, needs no additional commentary,” Putin said during the tightly-controlled visit.  A suicide bomb blast in Volgograd’s main railway station on Sunday afternoon killed at least 18 people, and a second attacker blew up a trolley bus during rush hour on Monday morning, killing 16 and leaving bodies strewn on the street.  Putin donned a white hospital coat for bedside visits to wounded victims and placed red roses at the site of the trolley bus bombing.  The bombings raised fears of more attacks before Russia holds the Winter Olympics in Sochi a Black Sea resort on the edge of the Caucasus Mountain range 690 km (430 miles) southwest of Volgograd.  While nobody has claimed responsibility, the attacks underscored Russia’s vulnerability to insurgents more than a decade after it drove separatists from power in the North Caucasus province of Chechnya during Putin’s first term.  Slideshow (7 Images)  “We will confidently, fiercely and consistently continue the fight against terrorists until their complete annihilation,” Putin told the nation in a New Year address televised from the far eastern city of Khabarovsk.  The insurgents say they are fighting to carve an Islamic state out of a swath of southern Russia that includes Sochi. In a video posted online in July, their Chechen-born leader called for “maximum force” to prevent Russia staging the Sochi Games.  Putin, 61, has staked his reputation on the success of the Olympics.

Thirteen former medical marijuana dispensaries newly cleared by state regulators to sell pot to consumers who are interested in nothing more than its mind- and mood-altering properties were slated to begin welcoming customers as early as 8 a.m. local time.  When they do, they will be launching an unprecedented commercial cannabis market that Colorado officials expect will ultimately gross $578 million in annual revenues, including $67 million in tax receipts for the state.  Possession, cultivation and private personal consumption of marijuana by adults for the sake of just getting high has already been legal in Colorado for more than a year under a state constitutional amendment approved by voters.  But starting New Year’s Day, cannabis will be legally produced, sold to the general public and taxed in a system modeled after a regime many states have in place for alcohol sales - but which exists for marijuana nowhere in the world outside of Colorado.  Due to the novelty factor, operators of the first group of retailers slated to open their doors in the Denver area and a handful of other locations were anticipating a surge in demand for store-bought weed.  Inside a warehouse tucked away in the blue-collar Denver suburb of Northglenn, a trio of workers were feverishly rolling hundreds of marijuana cigarettes by hand in preparation for the onslaught.  “We expect to have 2,000 joints ready to go by the time we open,” said Robin Hackett, 51, co-owner of Botana Care, who said she expects between 800 to 1,000 customers to patronize her store the first day.  The store has hired a private security firm to help with traffic and parking issues that might arise.  Hackett said she has 50 lbs (23 kg) of product on hand, and to avoid a supply shortage the shop will limit purchases to quarter-ounces on Wednesday, including joints, raw buds or cannabis-infused edibles such as pastries or candies.  A quarter-ounce sampler packet with seven strains of weed labeled with names such as “King Tut Kush” and “Gypsy Girl” - each said to produce a different kind of high - will retail for $85 to $90, including tax, Hackett said.  TURNING POINT IN DRUG CULTURE  Like other stores, Botana Care will also stock related wares, including pipes, rolling papers, bongs, and reusable, locking child-proof pouches.  Voters in Washington state voted to legalize marijuana at the same time Colorado did, in November 2012, but Washington is not slated to open its first retail establishments until later in 2014.  Still, supporters and detractors alike see the two Western states as embarking on an experiment that could mark the beginning of the end for marijuana prohibition at the national level.  “By legalizing marijuana, Colorado has stopped the needless and racially biased enforcement of marijuana prohibition laws,” said Ezekiel Edwards, director of the American Civil Liberties Union’s Criminal Law Reform Project.  Cannabis remains classified as an illegal narcotic under federal law, though the Obama administration has said it will give individual states leeway to carry out their own recreational-use statutes.  Nearly 20 states, including Colorado and Washington, had already put themselves at odds with the U.S. government by approving marijuana for medical purposes.  Opponents warned that legalizing recreational use could help create an industry intent on attracting underage users and getting more people dependent on the drug.  Comparing the nascent pot market to the alcohol industry, former U.S. Representative Patrick Kennedy, co-founder of Project Smart Approaches to Marijuana, said his group aims to curtail marijuana advertising and to help push local bans on the drug while the industry is still modest in stature.  “This is a battle that if we catch it early enough we can prevent some of the most egregious adverse impacts that have happened as a result of the commercialized market that promotes alcohol use to young people,” he said.  Under Colorado law, however, state residents can buy as much as an ounce (28 grams) of marijuana at a time, while out-of-state visitors are restricted to quarter-ounce purchases.  Restraint was certainly the message being propagated on New Year’s Eve by Colorado authorities, who posted signs at Denver International Airport and elsewhere around the capital warning that pot shops can only operate during approved hours, and that open, public consumption of marijuana remains illegal.

Delegations from both sides would arrive later on Wednesday, said regional bloc IGAD, as South Sudan’s government acknowledged it had lost the key town of Bor in the latest clash with militias loyal to former Vice President Riek Machar.  Government troops had made a “tactical retreat” to barracks 3 km (2 miles) away on Tuesday, said Nhial Majak Nhial, mayor of Bor, the capital of Jonglei state, which has untapped oil reserves and was the site of an ethnic massacre in 1991.  “I’m worried that the continued fighting in Bor might scupper the start of these talks,” said Ethiopian Foreign Minister Tedros Adhanom, who is chairman of the East African bloc the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) that is mediating.  IGAD said both sides would name teams of negotiators to agree on ways to roll out and monitor the ceasefire, in a bid to end the fighting that has killed at least 1,000, unsettled oil markets and raised fears of a civil war in a fragile region.  “We don’t want to expose the people of South Sudan to a senseless war,” South Sudan’s Foreign Minister Barnaba Marial Benjamin said on a government Twitter feed on Wednesday.  The government and rebels agreed to start talks under mounting pressure from regional and Western powers.  Washington, the United Nations and South Sudan’s neighbours played a central roll in negotiations that ended decades of civil war with Sudan to the north and led to the secession of South Sudan in 2011, and have been scrambling to stem the latest violence.  South Sudan holds the third-largest oil reserves in sub-Saharan Africa after Angola and Nigeria, according to BP, but remains one of the continent’s least developed countries.  WHITE HOUSE PRESSURE  President Salva Kiir has accused his long-term political rival Machar, who he sacked in July, of starting the fighting in a bid to seize power.  Clashes between soldiers erupted on Dec. 15 in the national capital Juba. The violence quickly spread to oil-producing areas, dividing the country along the ethnic lines of Machar’s Nuer group and Kiir’s Dinkas.  Machar has denied the charge, but he has taken to the bush and has acknowledged leading soldiers battling the government.  The White House upped the pressure late on Tuesday, saying it would deny support to any group that seized power by force.  “We will hold leaders responsible for the conduct of their forces and work to ensure accountability for atrocities and war crimes,” said spokeswoman Caitlin Hayden.  The United Nations Mission in South Sudan said ethnic-based atrocities, often carried out against civilians by uniformed men, have taken place across the country.  Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres (MSF) said about 70,000 civilians had fled Bor and sought refuge in the town of Awerial in neighbouring Lakes state, with no access to food, clean water or shelter. Others were hiding in swamps.  “Living conditions are verging on the catastrophic,” MSF said.  Fighting across the country has displaced at least 180,000 people, according to the United Nations.  The clashes have revived memories of the factionalism in the 1990s within the Sudan People’s Liberation Movement(SPLM), the now ruling group that fought Sudan’s army in the civil war. Machar led a splinter faction at the time and Nuer fighters loyal to him massacred Dinkas in Bor.

REUTERS/Vasily Fedosenko  Russian news media say the authorities suspect an ethnic-Russian convert to Islam may have been behind one of the two suicide bombings that killed a total of 34 people in the past two days in Volgograd, a southern Russian city.

Pavel Pechyonkin, named by Russian news agencies as a possible suspect in the first of two attacks within 24 hours - a suicide bomb that killed 18 people at Volgograd’s railway station on Sunday - was a paramedic from the Mari El region in central Russia.  An ethnic Russian on his father’s side, he converted to Islam, his mother’s religion.  He left home in 2011 to join insurgents in Dagestan, his parents said earlier this year in a video message posted on the Internet, appealing to their son to lay down arms.  In response, Pechyonkin recorded his own video message, saying he was following God’s will.  “Here Muslims are being killed and kidnapped ... Why should we follow those Christian commandments, when Allah urges us to fight those kafirs? Why shouldn’t we leave their children orphaned?” he said, wearing a green tunic and skull cap.  Authorities also believe an ethnic Russian from the Moscow suburbs, Dmitry Sokolov, built a suicide explosive belt detonated by his Dagestani wife in a bus bombing in Volgograd in October, law enforcement sources in Dagestan said.  The two met on online Islamist chat rooms. Sokolov was killed by Russian security forces in November, alongside four other militants in a house in Dagestan.  RECRUITS FROM AS FAR AS CANADA  Vladimir Putin crushed separatists in Chechnya when he rose to power 14 years ago. But an Islamist insurgency spread to neighboring Dagestan and remains the deadliest conflict in Europe. Fighters have recruited to their ranks from as far afield as Canada.  Yekaterina Sokirianskaya, a Caucasus expert at International Crisis Group, says many new converts adopt a fundamentalist form of Islam that often puts them in conflict with their families and makes them more prone to “radicalization”.  “They are very attractive to insurgents,” Sokirianskaya said. “The last attack could have been carried out only by a Slavic man, this is clear, because security measures were tightened and a women in a hijab would have been noticed.”  Heavy security around Sochi means an attack on the Black Sea resort city where the Olympics will be held in February would be extremely difficult, security experts say, but the greatest potential threat is from a suicide bomber.  “This is very effective tactic. It requires very little preparation and very little money, but it is very hard to stop,” Alexei Filatov, deputy head of the veterans’ association of the Alfa anti-terrorism unit.  Russian police have launched a security operation making no secret that they are targeting migrants from Muslim areas. A bomber recruited from another part of Russia, preferably with a Russian-sounding name, would have an easier time reaching a target than one with a Muslim name whose identity documents were issued in Chechnya or Dagestan.  More than 120 people have become suicide bombers during Putin’s rule, Grigory Shvedov, editor of website Kavkaz-uzel.ru, which tracks the unrest.  A harsh crackdown on adherents of the strict Salafist strand of Islam practiced by militants has added fuel to the insurgency, Shvedov and other experts say.  “Although brute force is being used in the North Caucasus now, they (the authorities) cannot build a wall thick enough to prevent terrorists from slipping out,” Shvedov said.  CAUCASUS EMIRATE  Local militant groups in Chechnya, Dagestan and other North Caucasus provinces united in 2007 under the leadership of Doku Umarov, a former Chechen rebel, whose Caucasus Emirate group says it was behind suicide bombings that killed 37 people at a Moscow airport in 2011 and 40 on the Moscow subway in 2010.  He urged his fighters in a video posted online in July to use “maximum force” to prevent Putin staging the Olympics.  Volgograd, about a day’s drive north along a main highway from the Caucasus, is a far easier target for militants than Sochi, the site of the Olympics, 700 km (440 miles) away.  Sochi, a 145-km (90-mile) long stretch of coastal resorts where Putin himself spends his summer holidays, has had its security beefed up with forces drawn from other cities. It is shielded by impassable mountains on one side and the Black Sea on the other, and can only be approached by air or a heavily guarded coastal road.  If they cannot reach Sochi itself, militants may have calculated instead on the symbolic value of sowing panic in Volgograd, one of the biggest cities in southern Russia with more than 1 million people.  The attack subverts its image as bastion of Russian strength earned through victory in a decisive battle in World War Two, when the city was known as Stalingrad.  “A symbol of Russia’s tragedy and triumph in World War Two has been singled out by the terrorists precisely because of its status in people’s minds,” said Dmitry Trenin, the director of the Moscow Carnegie Centre." }

Russian news media say the authorities suspect an ethnic-Russian convert to Islam may have been behind one of the two suicide bombings that killed a total of 34 people in the past two days in Volgograd, a southern Russian city.

Afghan military policemen stand guard during a ceremony handing over the Bagram prison to Afghan authorities, at the U.S. airbase in Bagram, north of Kabul March 25, 2013. REUTERS/Mohammad Ismail  The United States only recently transferred the prison at Bagram to Afghan control after it had become a serious source of tension with the government in Afghanistan which is fighting a Taliban-led insurgency.  Relations with Afghanistan have grown particularly strained over President Hamid Karzai’s refusal to sign a bilateral security deal that would keep around 8,000 U.S. troops in the country after 2014, when most foreign forces are due to leave.  A U.S. army official said the release of the 88 contravened a presidential decree to complete investigations at the prison and prosecute individuals when required.  “The Afghan Review Board has exceeded its mandate and ordered the release of a number of dangerous individuals who are legitimate threats and for whom there is strong evidence supporting prosecution or further investigation,” said Colonel Dave Lapan, a spokesman for U.S. forces in Afghanistan.  The United States long resisted handing over the facility - because it feared individuals it considered dangerous would be released - but ultimately reached a deal with the Afghan government in early 2013.  About 40 percent of the prisoners were directly responsible for wounding or killing 57 Afghan civilians and security forces, and 30 percent had participated in direct attacks that killed or wounded 60 U.S. and coalition troops, a U.S. official said.  The head of the Afghan commission charged with reviewing the cases denied that the 88 posed a threat.  “In many cases, detainees were wrongly linked to certain incidents they were not involved in,” said Abdul Shakor Dadras.  The planned release will however alarm many senior Afghan security sources, who often see released prisoners return to the battlefield.  The bilateral security deal has to be signed for the United States and its allies to provide billions more dollars in aid.  Without a deal, the United States could pull all of its troops out, the so-called zero option, leaving Afghan forces to battle the Taliban on their own.  Karzai however has said the deal can wait until after presidential elections, scheduled for April, and that the “zero option” is an empty threat." }

The cliche couldn’t be more appropriate for the Los Angeles Lakers.  Milwaukee guard Brandon Knight scored a career-high 37 points, and the Bucks earned a 94-79 victory Tuesday night over the reeling Lakers before a sellout crowd of 18,997 at Staples Center.  The Bucks, who have the worst record in the NBA at 7-24 and own a 4-12 mark on the road, ended a three-game losing streak and won for the second time in 10 games. They also extended the Lakers’ skid to a season-high six games.  Injuries continue to take a toll on the Lakers, who lost Jordan Farmar on Tuesday. The point guard left the game with hamstring tightness, and he is scheduled to undergo an MRI exam Wednesday.  For Milwaukee, however, the New Year’s Eve game was a celebratory affair.  “My teammates did a great job (of) just running the floor, running the lanes, and I think that opened it up for me,” said Knight, who hit 15 of 25 shots from the floor, including three of eight 3-point attempts. “But it started with our defense. We got after it defensively. Part of it was them missing shots, but I also want to give credit to our guys for contesting those shots.  “Guys did a great job of just playing hard and sticking with it and keeping the energy up. We normally have lapses, but I thought we did a great job tonight of taking their runs and fighting back.”  Milwaukee forward Ersan Ilyasova scored 15 points and pulled down 12 rebounds, while guard Luke Ridnour added 11 points.  Center Pau Gasol and guard Nick Young scored 25 each to lead the Lakers, who lost at home to two of the league’s weakest clubs in a three-day span. The Philadelphia 76ers captured a victory over the Lakers on Sunday at Staples Center.  “We’re struggling. We just didn’t play well,” Lakers coach Mike D’Antoni said. “We didn’t do anything well. Yep, we’re down at the bottom.”  The Lakers (13-19) experienced an awful start and never recovered against Milwaukee, which won its first game against a Western Conference club in seven attempts. Los Angeles missed its first 11 shots from the field before Gasol finally hit a jumper nearly seven minutes into the game. By then, Milwaukee had a 14-2 lead. The Bucks led by as much as 17 before Los Angeles cut the margin to 23-12 at the end of the quarter.  By the half, the Bucks held a 42-33 lead as they limited the Lakers to 28.3 percent shooting (13 of 46) while hitting 40.8 percent (20 of 49) from the floor. Overall, the Bucks shot 44 percent (40 of 91) to 35.8 percent (29 of 81) for the Lakers. Milwaukee also outscored Los Angeles 42-26 in the paint.  “I think our defense was the key,” said Ridnour, who scored all of his points in the second half. “It got us out to a good start and built some confidence. As long as our defense is solid, that’s going to help.”  Knight provided the bulk of the offense. He scored 18 of his points in the third quarter, hitting eight of his 12 shots and helping the Bucks stretch their lead to as much as 22 points. A 3-pointer by forward Khris Middleton gave Milwaukee a 72-50 advantage with 2:22 remaining, but the Lakers closed with a 10-2 run to pull to within 74-60 heading into the fourth quarter.  Los Angeles, however, never managed to get any closer than nine in the fourth.  Even before Farmar exited, the Lakers were short-handed.  Forward Wesley Johnson missed the game due to gastroenteritis, and guard Xavier Henry is expected to be out for seven to 10 days with a bone bruise in his right knee. Henry suffered the injury in Sunday’s loss to the 76ers.  In addition, forward Chris Kaman, who has complained publicly about his lack of playing time, is nursing a sprained ankle. D’Antoni said Kaman could have played, but the coach chose not to use him.  Related Coverage Preview: Bucks at Lakers  “We’ve got to somehow band together and figure it out anyway,” D’Antoni said. “We can’t use (injuries) as an excuse. We’ve got a couple of days to figure this out, but we do have to get some guys back from injury. We’ve got to get a little lucky a little bit.”  NOTES: Bucks G Luke Ridnour got the start instead of F Khris Middleton to give the team another ball-handler, coach Larry Drew said before the game. Drew, who moved 6-foot-9 G/F Giannis Antetokounmpo inside to make room for Ridnour in the backcourt, also said he is seeking to find the right mix and provide his club a much-needed boost. Milwaukee used 18 different starting lineups over its first 31 games. By comparison, the Lakers used 17 different starting lineups in 32 games. ...

The uncompromising remarks in a televised New Year address were Putin’s first public comments since suicide bombers killed at least 34 people in attacks less than 24 hours apart on a railway station and a trolleybus on Sunday and Monday.  But after two decades of violence in the North Caucasus, Islamist militants continue to pose a threat beyond their home region. Russia’s Olympic Committee chief said no more could be done to safeguard the Games since every measure possible was already in place around Sochi, beneath the Caucasus mountains.  The bombings just ahead of Russia’s biggest annual holiday followed another suicide bus blast in Volgograd in October and came little more than a month before the start of Games on whose success Putin has staked his personal reputation.  “We will confidently, fiercely and consistently continue the fight against terrorists until their complete annihilation,” he said in remarks from the far eastern city of Khabarovsk, where he met victims of severe floods.  Putin travelled early on Wednesday to Volgograd, where he visited wounded victims in hospital, placed red roses at the trolleybus bombing site and held a meeting on countertterrorism efforts with senior security officials, the Kremlin said.  In the New Year address, he acknowledged “problems and serious tests” in 2013, including the Volgograd bombings, and vowed to ensure security in the year ahead.  Putin, who came to power when Boris Yeltsin announced his resignation on New Year’s Eve 14 years ago, won popularity early in his presidency by crushing efforts to forge an independent state in Chechnya, but he has been unable to stop Chechen and other Islamist militants across the North Caucasus.  Police detained dozens of people in sweeps through Volgograd on Tuesday but there was no indication any were linked to the attacks, for which no one claimed responsibility.  Mourners laid flowers at the site of the bombing that tore the bus apart and left residents fearing further violence.  “I’m frightened,” said Tatyana Volchanskaya, a student in Volgograd, 700 km (400 miles) northeast of Sochi. She said some friends were afraid to go to shops and other crowded places.  SOCHI SAID SECURE  Putin ordered tighter security nationwide after the blasts, but Russian Olympic chief Alexander Zhukov said no additional measures would be taken at Sochi: “As for the Olympic Games, all necessary security measures have been foreseen,” Interfax news agency quoted him as saying on Monday.  “Additional measures will not be taken in Sochi as a result of the terrorist act. Everything necessary has been done as it is.”  Putin has staked his prestige on the Feb. 7-23 Games in Sochi, which lies at the Western edge of the Caucasus mountains and within the strip of land the insurgents want to carve out of Russia and turn into an Islamic state.  Insurgent leader Doku Umarov has urged militants to use “maximum force” to prevent the Games from going ahead.  Russia drove separatists from power in Chechnya in a war that boosted the popularity of Putin, a former KGB officer.  But the insurgency that spread across the North Caucasus region in the aftermath of that conflict has persisted despite Putin’s repeated, strongly worded pledges to eliminate the militants whose attacks have cast a shadow over his rule.  As prime minister in 1999, he vowed to “wipe them out in the shithouse” and in 2010, after female suicide bombers killed 40 people on the Moscow metro, he ordered police to find their masters and “scrape them from the bottom of the sewers”.  Less than a year later, in January 2011, a bomber from the North Caucasus killed 37 people at a busy Moscow airport.  The rail station bombing in Volgograd was the deadliest attack outside the North Caucasus since then, killing 18 people. Citing unnamed sources, Interfax said the suspected attacker was an ethnic Russian convert to Islam who moved to Dagestan where he joined militants early in 2012.  Investigators said they believed a male suicide bomber was also responsible for Monday’s morning rush-hour blast.  PUTIN’S LEGACY  Volgograd - formerly Stalingrad - is a city of a million and a transport hub for an area of southern Russia that includes the North Caucasus.  A car bomb killed a prosecutor’s assistant in Dagestan on Tuesday and two people were killed in a bomb blast there late on Monday, authorities said.  In Volgograd, more than 5,000 police and interior troops were mobilised in “Operation Anti-terror Whirlwind”, Interior Ministry spokesman Andrei Pilipchuk said. He said 87 people had been detained after they resisted police or could not produce proper ID or registration documents, and that some had weapons.  State television showed helmeted officers pushing men up against a wall. But there was no sign any were linked to the bombings or suspected of planning further attacks.  Itar-Tass news agency said police were focusing on migrant workers from the Caucasus and ex-Soviet states - groups that rights activists say face discrimination from police.  The success or failure of the Olympics will form a big part of the legacy of Putin, 60. He secured the Games for Sochi in 2007, during his first stint as president, and has not ruled out seeking a new six-year term in 2018.  Intended to showcase how Russia has changed since the collapse of Soviet communism in 1991, the Games have also been a focus for complaints in the West and among Russian liberals that Putin has stifled dissent and encouraged intolerance.  This month, Putin freed jailed opponents including oil tycoon Mikhail Khodorkovsky and the Pussy Riot punk band in what critics said was an effort to disarm Western criticism and improve his image.

They’re finding ways to win and they’re a confident team right now.”  Center Brayden Schenn scored for the second straight game to break a 1-1 deadlock late in the second period before the sellout crowd of 19,289, which sent the surging Flyers off and running and was a dagger for a flagging Flames team that has lost three straight games since the Christmas break and netted only one victory in eight outings.  “We did lots of great things around the net, but we couldn’t get that big goal,” said Flames coach Bob Hartley. “I think their second goal, late in the second period, kinda hurt us. I felt that we were getting good momentum, we were skating better, and that goal ... we took a big hit. We kept working but just couldn’t get back in the game.  “We need to support them. They’re working. No one makes a bad read or a bad pass on person. The one thing we will not accept is a lack of effort, and that’s definitely not the case.”  Defenseman Mark Streit, left winger Scott Hartnell and defenseman Braydon Coburn also scored for the Flyers, who collected shootout wins over both the Edmonton Oilers and Vancouver Canucks to kick off their post-Christmas schedule that starts with a six-game road trip.  Goalie Ray Emery made 23 saves to net his fourth victory in 12 decisions this season for the Flyers (20-16-4).  “It’s a good stretch,” Emery said. “It’s a good way to end the calendar year, especially after the way we started the season. To be where we’re at starting the New Year, I think we’ll take it.”  Rookie center Sean Monahan’s second period tally snapped Calgary’s goal-scoring drought at 159 minutes and 35 seconds for a Flames team blanked in its previous two games.  “Putting the puck in the net gives you confidence and it’s big for me to put the puck in the net, and that helps the team, but at the end of the day I want to win games,” said Monahan, who has 11 goals this season.  As for the rest of the Flames, their struggles continue and confidence is waning.  “That can be a little bit of an excuse,” said right winger Lee Stempniak. “We’re all in the NHL because you’re a good player and you have to believe, ultimately, in yourself and that you’re capable of getting the job done. You certainly feel a little bit better if you’ve been scoring, but, to me, that’s a little bit of a cop-out. You’ve got to take ownership of it and be ready for the next opportunity that comes.”  Related Coverage Preview: Flyers at Flames  Goaltender Karri Ramo stopped 17 shots for the Flames (14-20-6).

More than 2 million people enrolled in private plans offered under the Affordable Care Act, popularly known as Obamacare, during the initial sign-up period for health benefits starting Jan. 1. Enrollment began in October and lasts through March, but Americans in most states had to enroll by last week to get coverage that takes effect with the start of the new year.  The expansion of coverage through the new plans is one of the signature parts of the 2010 law, which is the most sweeping U.S. social legislation in 50 years. Over time, the law - which requires most Americans to buy insurance, offers subsidies to help low-income people get covered and sets minimum standards for coverage - aims to dramatically reduce the number of Americans who lack health insurance, which the U.S. government has estimated at more than 45 million.  After a difficult October launch plagued by problems with the website used to enroll people in coverage, the focus now for the government and healthcare providers has turned to what will happen beginning Wednesday, when patients with the new coverage start to seek care.  At the start, confirming a patient’s plan may present headaches for care providers. The Obama administration has acknowledged that errors occurred in transmitting enrollment data to insurers, especially early in the enrollment period.  Although government officials say they have dramatically improved the process, healthcare providers are concerned about problems or delays in verifying coverage with insurers.  “It will be difficult for us to actually verify coverage - that’s my concern,” said Dr. William Wulf, CEO of Central Ohio Primary Care, which has 250 primary care physicians.  The task could be made more difficult by decisions by the U.S. government and many states to push back enrollment deadlines toward the end of the year, and to allow some patients well into January to pay for coverage that is retroactive to the start of the year.  The late deadlines mean that many enrollees who seek care initially may lack insurance cards or other proof of coverage.  Wulf said his physician offices will assume that an existing patient is covered if they claim to be when they come in for appointments and their coverage cannot be verified immediately. But if they require expensive tests, such as MRIs or heart-stress tests that can cost up to $700, the Ohio practice will check with insurers first to make sure the patient has coverage.  Similarly, Dr. Andy Chiou, CEO of Peoria Surgical Group Ltd in Illinois, said that if the practice finds a “significant minority” of its patients do not have coverage when they believe they do, it might delay elective surgeries for patients until their insurance is confirmed.  “For the protection of patients and us, we’ll have to say, ‘Sorry, you don’t have insurance,’” Chiou said.  POLITICAL STAKES HIGH  For the Obama administration, the political stakes are high in ensuring a smooth transition period for coverage, particularly after the website’s problems damaged the popularity of the Democratic president and the healthcare overhaul, his top domestic achievement.  Republicans who have called Obamacare a costly program that will rob many Americans of insurance choices have said they will make Obamacare’s problems their top issue in the November 2014 elections, when control of Congress will be at stake.  White House health policy adviser Phil Schiliro said on Tuesday that because of the intense focus on Obamacare, “problems that have never gotten attention before will get some attention now.”  The U.S. government has tried to anticipate the coverage problems new enrollees might encounter. The federally run Healthcare.Gov website last week posted advice on what enrollees should do if they have not received an insurance card, encounter problems getting coverage for a drug prescription, or need to appeal a decision by an insurer.  “For consumers whose marketplace coverage begins on January 1, we’re doing everything we can to help ensure a smooth transition period,” Kathleen Sebelius, the U.S. secretary of health and human services, said in blog posting on Tuesday.  “What we are stressing to folks is that if they get to a provider (and) there is some confusion (about coverage), call their insurer,” Schiliro said. “If the insurer is not able to resolve it, they should call our toll-free number (800-318-2596) ... and operators will be there 24/7.”  Some healthcare companies are trying to get ahead of potential problems as well.  The pharmacy chain Walgreen Co said on Monday that it would allow consumers who have not yet received a plan identification number from their insurer to get prescriptions at no upfront cost in January, if they can provide evidence of their coverage or pharmacy staff can otherwise confirm it.  Wal-Mart on Tuesday said it would institute a similar practice.  HOSPITALS READY FOR CHANGE  Hospital executives, meanwhile, said they were ready for potential hiccups with the newly insured.  The vast majority of Americans have employer-based coverage and Medicare plans and can choose new plans every January, so executives said the beginning of the Obamacare plans represented a more intense version of an insurance transition period they already are familiar with.  “Hospitals feel like they’re pretty well prepared because they’ve had systems in place and tools in place to work through these sorts of issues,” said Jeff Goldman, vice president of coverage policy for the American Hospital Association. “We expect an uptick in volume, but we don’t think it’s anything beyond what most hospitals are prepared to handle.”  As many as 7 million people were expected to sign up for coverage in the Obamacare plans for 2014, but enrollment so far is well short of that figure largely because of the problems with the HealthCare.gov website. Residents of 36 states use the site to enroll; those in the other 14 states use state-run websites. Hospitals, therefore, may have been preparing for more new enrollees than they are likely to see at this point.  At New York’s Montefiore Medical Center, staffers were trained on how the new healthcare plans work in part so they can help patients resolve any coverage issues, said Lynn Richmond, the medical center’s chief of staff.  “There’s not a lot of active worry on our part,” Richmond said. “We feel ready to manage the hiccups.”  Indeed, many have eagerly anticipated the law’s broadening of coverage. Across the nation, hospital operators’ finances have been weighed down by patients who have been unable to pay their bills because they lacked sufficient insurance.  “We’re looking forward to the first quarter and beyond because we feel we’re in a very good position to benefit from the ACA,” said Steven Campanini, a spokesman for Tenet Healthcare Corp, one of the largest publicly traded hospital chains." }

Down on Mexico’s Pacific coast, a drug gang was already making it a reality.  The Knights Templar cartel, steadily diversifying into other businesses, became so successful at exporting iron ore to China that the Mexican Navy in November had to move in and take over the port in Lazaro Cardenas, a city that has become one of the gang’s main cash generators.  This steelmaking center, drug smuggling hot spot and home of a rapidly growing container port in the western state of Michoacan occupies a strategic position on the Pacific coast, making it a natural gateway for burgeoning trade with China.  Lazaro Cardenas opened to container traffic just a decade ago, and with a harbor deep enough to berth the world’s largest ships, it already aims to compete with Los Angeles to handle Asian goods bound for the U.S. market.  But that future is in doubt unless the government can restore order and win its struggle with the Knights Templar, who took their name from a medieval military order that protected Christian pilgrims during the Crusades.  Mexico’s biggest producer of iron ore, Michoacan state is a magnet for Chinese traders feeding demand for steel in their homeland. But the mines also created an opportunity for criminal gangs, such as the Knights Templar, looking to broaden their revenue base into more legitimate businesses.  “The mines were mercilessly exploited, and the ore was leaving. But not in rafts or launches - it was going via the port, through customs, on ships,” said Michoachan’s governor, Fausto Vallejo, soon after the Navy occupied the port on Nov. 4.  Already a thriving criminal enterprise adept at corrupting local officials and squeezing payments from businesses, developers and farmers, the Knights took to mining with aplomb, according to entrepreneurs and miners working around the port.  Hidden behind mountain roads about an hour from Lazaro Cardenas, one small town mustered hundreds of trucks this year to lead the gang’s scramble to the port, a local miner said.  That town - Arteaga - is the birthplace of Servando Gomez, the former school teacher who leads the Knights Templar.  Gomez understood the potential of Lazaro Cardenas, which was a village best known for its coconuts until the government decided to build a steelworks there 40 years ago.  The gang’s trucks sped around Michoacan’s iron mines to supply Chinese buyers, helping to push ore exports to 4 million tonnes by October from 1-1.5 million tonnes a year previously.  Their business rests on several pillars, according to accounts of local officials, miners and entrepreneurs.  Firstly, the Knights controlled how the ore moved, having imposed protection charges on local transport unions after becoming the dominant gang in the city a few years ago.  It also helped local prospectors stake claims to mine areas either unclaimed by others or beyond the control of the existing concession-holders. Then the Knights took their cut.  Finally, the gang pressured customs officials to ensure the ore passed through the port smoothly.  “Most of the groups mining are Knights Templar or belong to them. They have the whole chain,” a local official told Reuters.  Fueled by the appetite of Chinese buyers, about half the mining in the area was done without proper permits this year, said the official, speaking on condition of anonymity.  Those who talk openly can pay dearly. In April, an official at steel maker ArcelorMittal who local businessmen said had reported illegal mining to authorities was shot dead.  One prospector from Arteaga, who asked to remain anonymous, said he ran a mine selling unprocessed iron ore to Chinese traders for $32 per tonne, giving him a profit of about $5-7 per tonne. By the time it reached China, the buyers could expect to sell the ore for a profit of around $15 per tonne, he estimated.  Because the Knights Templar control much of the local iron supply, the gang has pressured Chinese buyers to purchase ore from them or face reprisals, said a Mexican government security official who spoke on condition of anonymity.  The combination of organized crime and Chinese buying of Mexican iron ore poses a problem for President Enrique Pena Nieto, who has gone out of his way to cultivate ties with China.  China’s President Xi Jinping has been in office only since March, but Pena Nieto has already met him three times. In June, Pena Nieto welcomed Xi to Mexico, signing a string of economic cooperation deals. But at the top of the agenda was how to narrow the massive trade imbalance between the two nations.  Bilateral trade was worth $62.7 billion in 2012, up from just $431 million two decades ago, Mexican data shows. But 90 percent is accounted for by Chinese exports to Mexico, most of it goods such as computers and component parts.  CHAOS, LOCKDOWN, MORE CHAOS  Much of that trade goes directly through Lazaro Cardenas.  In 2012, it had the biggest rise in traffic in North America’s 20 top container ports, handling 1.2 million 20-foot equivalent units, or teus.  Most of the port is still a dusty plain above which birds of prey soar in stifling heat. In a few years, though, projects started by Maersk-unit APM Terminals and Hutchison Port Holdings could expand its capacity to about 8 million teus - the amount moved in 2012 by the continent’s top container hub, Los Angeles.  But Michoacan is not California.  Seven years ago, then-President Felipe Calderon began a nationwide crackdown on organized crime in Michoacan, sending in the army to tackle increasingly violent drug cartels.  Over 80,000 people have since died in gang-related killings across Mexico, and assurances Pena Nieto gave that he would stop the rot when he took power a year ago are wearing thin.  Although parts of Mexico have become safer since Pena Nieto took office, Michoacan has fallen into even more chaos.  Over half of the state lives in poverty. Traditional work like resin production is dying out due to competition from China and elsewhere. That creates new recruits for organized crime.  In October, a local bishop likened Michoacan to a failed state. A few days later, assailants temporarily knocked out power for hundreds of thousands in the state with a string of attacks on installations of the national electricity utility.  Many blamed the Knights, though signs posted in Michoacan accused a small rival gang of staging the attack.  The Navy took over the port authority and reinforced Lazaro Cardenas shortly afterward. All the local police and customs officials were initially suspended and the caravans of trucks carting ore started to thin out.  But the lull is unlikely to last unless the government can regain control of the city beyond the port gates and open up mining to legitimate prospectors not controlled by the gang.  Miners complain that the main concession-holders such as ArcelorMittal, which did not respond to requests for comment, use only a fraction of their land and are reluctant to let others mine it. The Knights have turned that dispute into money.  Days after the Navy moved in, state governor Vallejo said criminal enterprise around Lazaro Cardenas could be worth up to $2 billion a year - or about half Michoacan’s 2012 budget.  ‘EVERYONE IS PAYING’  Some involved in the mining industry say the area has become safer since the Knights Templar started to take control.  But the facts suggest otherwise: government figures show kidnappings in Michoacan reached a record level in 2013, and murders climbed to a 15-year peak.  Gomez has appeared in several YouTube videos trying to portray his Knights Templar as defenders of Michoacan.  In one posted in August, he said the Knights had provided paid protection at the request of avocado farmers but that they did not extort businesses. However, he also conceded that some “foolish” members of his gang probably had engaged in extortion.  The Knights’ power in Lazaro Cardenas is often subtle.  Unlike parts of northern Mexico living under the threat of violence, the restaurants, taco stands and bars on the city’s main palm-lined boulevard are alive with people as night falls.  Some residents say they are not squeezed by the cartel, and big companies say they can operate without fear of extortion.  “We don’t pay a cent to anyone,” said Jose Zozaya, head of Kansas City Southern Mexico, which operates the rail link that connects the port with the United States.  But others quickly vent their anger about the Knights.  “Everyone is paying, but they won’t tell you,” said a local entrepreneur. “The people here are destroyed.”  The port is no stranger to crime, and during Calderon’s presidency it became a big entry point for chemicals from China and other parts of Asia used to make methamphetamine. Some locals say chemicals have even been used to pay gangs for the iron ore.  Asked if Mexico had discussed the iron ore issue with Beijing, a senior government official said: “The Chinese government doesn’t always know what the companies are doing. The occupation of the port ... was the control measure adopted.”  Hua Chunying, a Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, said she was unaware of the situation in Lazaro Cardenas, adding: “But I can tell you that the Chinese government has consistently educated and asked Chinese companies to respect the law in other countries when they carry out business and trade cooperation.”  Successful Chinese firms are growing quickly in the region.  Since setting up in 2009, Desarrollo Minero Unificado de Mexico (DMU), a Chinese iron mining company in Lazaro Cardenas, has gone from three employees to 600 nationwide, nearly all of them Mexicans, Director General Luis Lu told Reuters.  With more than 30 concessions, Lu said his company mined all of its own iron and had not had any trouble with organized crime. He said he could not say how other Chinese firms fared.  Still, Chinese success in Michoacan has caused friction with the Knights Templar. In the August YouTube video, gang leader Gomez had some strong words for them.  “We have an excessive invasion of Chinese. An excess of Chinese,” he said, surrounded by armed men. “It may suit the interests of various corporations, I don’t know. But they’re here with us now. And these people have their mafias too.”" }

It would be hard for the Phoenix Coyotes defenseman to make a stronger last-minute case than he did on New Year’s Eve.  Yandle set up winger Mikkel Boedker’s game-tying goal with one minute and 10 seconds remaining in regulation, then buried the game-winner with 6.5 seconds left in overtime to complete a three-point night as the Coyotes rallied to beat the Edmonton Oilers 4-3 on Tuesday at Jobing.com Arena.  “I haven’t gotten any hints whatsoever,” said Yandle when asked about his Olympic prospects. “From what I’m told, we’re going to find out when everybody else finds out.”  Tuesday’s game marked the sixth straight overtime game for Phoenix, which set a franchise record. The Coyotes have also registered a league-high 14 points in games in which they’ve trailed by two or more goals this season.  “We don’t mind it,” Yandle said. “We like coming from behind to win. If you look at the games we’ve been down, we’ve shown resilience and the calmness in our group to know that we can get a goal and get back in it.”  Phoenix jumped out to a 1-0 lead on the power play when Yandle covered for his own gaffe by intercepting a clearing pass, dodging defenders and ripping a low shot past the blocker side of Edmonton goaltender Ilya Bryzgalov 10:59 into the first period.  But despite a decided edge in play for the Coyotes, the Oilers evened the game at 1 with just over a minute left in the period when center Ryan Nugent-Hopkins somehow knocked a puck between his own legs with his back to the Phoenix net. Coyotes goalie Mike Smith never saw the shot and it slipped between his legs.  Edmonton then widened its lead to 3-1 with a pair of goals less than seven minutes into the second period. Forward David Perron scored his 17th goal of the season on forward Taylor Hall’s second assist of the night. Defenseman Justin Schultz then took a feed from Hall in the deep slot and snapped a shot through Smith’s pads for a 3-1 lead.  “The first period was the first taste and we didn’t like that that much,” said Oilers coach Dallas Eakins in explaining his team’s turnaround.  Coyotes coach Dave Tippett didn’t like what he was seeing so he opted to change goalies to backup Thomas Greiss. Smith was victimized by some poor defensive zone coverage, but he allowed three goals on just 10 shots.  “The change in goal was strictly about changing momentum,” Tippett said. “Greisser came in and stabilized things a little bit for us there and our team found a way to hang around.”  Phoenix winger Tim Kennedy pulled the Coyotes within 3-2 at the 12:05 mark of the second period when he banked a shot off Bryzgalov’s leg from behind the end line and into the net.  With the Coyotes applying steady pressure in the third period, Yandle finally set up the equalizer by drawing the defense and Bryzgalov to him before slipping the puck to Boedker for an easy tap-in.  He then beat Bryzgalov on a breakaway over the shoulder with the clock winding down in overtime to earn the Coyotes two points.  “If there’s a way to put a last-minute push on, that was a great last-minute push,” Tippett said of Yandle. “Obviously, I’m biased, but I see him day in, day out and he’s been one of our top players. I certainly think he deserves to be there. He’s played well enough to be there.”  The loss dropped Edmonton to 2-11-2 all-time in New Year’s Eve games.  Related Coverage Preview: Oilers at Coyotes  “In the second and third, I thought we played well,” Eakins said. “I thought we were matching them and (Nugent-Hopkins’ line) was really getting after them. That last goal was tough to swallow.”  NOTES: Coyotes GM Don Maloney said the club is close to terminating RW Gilbert Brule’s contract after he refused a re-assignment to the AHL. ...

REUTERS/Aly Song  Prices of new homes in 288 cities in December rose 0.37 percent in December from November, when they had risen 0.77 percent, a poll by real estate services firm E-House China EJ.N showed on Wednesday.  House prices climbed 10.04 percent from a year earlier, little changed from November’s annual rise of 10.11 percent and a seventh consecutive month of double-digit annual gains.  A separate survey by China Real Estate Index System (CREIS) on Tuesday showed average prices in the 100 biggest cities rose 0.7 percent in December from November, when they had risen 0.68 percent, to post a 19th straight monthly gain.  On average, prices rose 11.5 percent in December from a year earlier, CREIS said in a statement, with prices in seven cities including Beijing and Xiamen increasing by 20 to 30 percent.  “With the housing supply increasing in 2014, shortages are likely to be eased and developers will become more rational,” said CREIS, a consultancy linked to China’s largest online property information firm, Soufun Holdings (SFUN.N).  “But there might be increasing divergence between big and small cities,” it added.  House prices have surged in the past year, in part due to a view that property remains one of the best investments. That has prompted the government to try to head off bubbles in the market without damaging one of the pillars of growth in a slowing economy.  Despite the steps, which include clampdowns on mortgage lending, increased construction of affordable homes and promises of more land for building, many Chinese find home ownership well beyond their reach.  Analysts say Beijing won’t want to see a sudden and sharp downturn in the property market as the leadership tries to steer the world’s second-largest economy towards more sustainable growth after three decades of breakneck expansion.  The economy is expected to have grown about 7.5 percent in 2013, the weakest pace since the Asia financial crisis in the late 1990s.  A Reuters poll in November had predicted a slowdown in house price growth, with analysts forecasting a 5.0 percent rise in house prices in 2014 after a 10 percent gain last year.

Get on the power play against the Columbus Blue Jackets.  Centers Ryan O’Reilly and Nathan MacKinnon had a goal and an assist each, goaltender Semyon Varlamov stopped 35 shots, and the Avalanche beat the Blue Jackets 5-3 Tuesday night.  Defenseman Jan Hejda and left wingers Jamie McGinn and Gabriel Landeskog added goals to help the Avalanche stop a four-game losing streak.  Colorado (24-11-4) went 3-for-3 on the power play, the first time the Avalanche were perfect on the man advantage this season.  “I don’t think five-on-five we played our best game tonight, but our power play was huge for us,” O’Reilly said, “and it came at crucial times to give us momentum.”  Center Ryan Johansen and left winger Nick Foligno had a goal and assist each for the Blue Jackets (17-19-4). Center Boone Jenner also scored, and goalie Curtis McElhinney had 18 saves for Columbus, which dropped its second straight despite controlling the play most of the game.  “We outshot them and out-chanced them and still came up short,” center Mark Letestu said. “There a lot of positives, but it’s not good enough. Our penalty kill’s got to step up. Last two games we’ve been burned pretty good.”  The Avalanche earned points but not wins over the past 10 days. Two shootout losses and an overtime setback gave them their longest losing streak of the season.  Earning three points in the skid helped take some of the sting away.  “We got some points, we’ve been right there, but for us to respond and bury our chances (Tuesday) makes a world of difference,” O’Reilly said.  Columbus was playing well of late. The Blue Jackets won three straight, including two road games, before falling to Pittsburgh at home Sunday.  But like Tuesday, the penalty kill was their downfall against the Penguins.  “That’s two games in a row we’ve given up three goals,” Columbus coach Todd Richards said. “You’re not going to win any games in this league if you’re giving up three goals on the power play.”  The Blue Jackets carried the play for the first two periods. They wound up outshooting Colorado 38-23 despite trailing on the scoreboard much of the way.  “We didn’t have our legs at the start of the game. We didn’t have the start that we expected,” Avalanche coach Patrick Roy said. “I’ll give credit to them, they played really well at the start of the game. We had another outstanding performance from our goalie.”  Columbus took a 2-1 lead near the midway point of the second when Jenner batted in left winger Blake Comeau’s shot from the point for his fifth goal of the season.  The Avalanche, who managed just five shots on goal in the second, made a couple of them count. They tied it when McGinn backhanded center Matt Duchene’s shot through McElhinney’s legs at 12:04.  Duchene had two assists.  O’Reilly gave Colorado a 3-2 lead — its first lead since Dec. 23 — when he scored on the power play 2:38 after McGinn’s goal. It was O’Reilly’s 13th of the season.  The Avalanche went up 4-2 on Landeskog’s power-play goal at 8:10 of the third, but Foligno knocked in a rebound 37 seconds later to get Columbus within one again.  The Blue Jackets were pressing for the equalizer before Foligno went off for tripping with 1:30 left in the game. MacKinnon scored 26 seconds later to ice it.  “When we do move the puck around, change sides and let the puck do the job, it’s going to open up seams,” Landeskog said. “Tonight we capitalized.”  Related Coverage Preview: Blue Jackets at Avalanche  The Blue Jackets outshot the Avalanche 26-15 in the last two periods despite being down a player. Right wing Jack Skille played one shift in the second period before leaving with an upper-body injury.  NOTES: Avalanche RW P.A. Parenteau is expected to miss up to six weeks after suffering a second-degree sprain of the medial collateral ligament in his right knee Sunday.

De Blasio’s formal inauguration ceremony will take place at noon on Wednesday at City Hall, where former U.S. President Bill Clinton will administer the oath of office using a Bible once owned by Franklin Delano Roosevelt.  Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who led the city through its response to the attacks of Sept. 11, 2001, and the recession six years later, and whose policies have been credited with making the city safer, greener and more livable, is leaving City Hall after 12 years.  Bloomberg plans to take a two-week vacation in Hawaii and New Zealand with his longtime girlfriend, Diana Taylor. Then, the billionaire, who has homes in Bermuda and London, has said he will focus on his charitable foundation, Bloomberg Philanthropies, and remain active in public health, gun control and government innovation.  On the campaign trail, de Blasio presented himself as an anti-Bloomberg, decrying the “tale of two cities” that emerged as New York shed its reputation, from the 1970s and 1980s, as a gritty and dangerous place.  After a resounding victory in November with more than 70 percent of the vote, de Blasio has pledged to confront the affordability gap that has led to those in the middle and at the bottom of the economic ladder struggling to pay for basic services such as housing and mass transit.  Over the last decade, as the city prospered, apartment rents in New York City rose about 44 percent and the cost of a monthly Metro card jumped 60 percent.  De Blasio has made some major promises, and his critics are likely to quickly seize on his ability to deliver.  His signature proposal of creating universal access to pre-Kindergarten and middle school after-school programs depends on the approval - by state lawmakers and Governor Andrew Cuomo - of an income tax increase on the city’s highest earners. Cooperation from Albany is far from assured.  De Blasio has also pledged to improve police and community relations to continue New York’s historic drop in crime, as well as to fight the closure of community hospitals.  While Bloomberg has left the city with no budget deficit for the current fiscal year, contracts for all of the public sector unions have expired. In a press conference on Tuesday afternoon, de Blasio said he hoped to have the new contracts in place within a year.  De Blasio began his career in government working under David Dinkins, the city’s first black mayor who was elected in 1986 and was the last Democrat to hold the post. In 2000, when former U.S. first lady Hillary Clinton ran for U.S. senator in New York state, de Blasio was her campaign manager.  He went on to serve two terms on the New York City Council and four years ago was elected public advocate - a citywide office with a budget of just $2 million that is generally seen as a springboard for the job of mayor.  On Wednesday, the city’s new comptroller, Scott Stringer, and its new public advocate, Letitia James, will also be sworn in. Both are Democrats and close allies of de Blasio.
